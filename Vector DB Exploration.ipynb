Well-preserved skeletons, ranging in age from juveniles to adults, have been found in Europe, North America and Argentina.\\n\\nOphthalmosaurus had the largest eyes of any vertebrate relative to its body size. Its eyes, 4 inches in diameter, occupied most of the space in the skull. They were protected by bony plates (sclerotic rings), which most likely assisted to maintain the shape of the eyeballs against water pressure at depth.\\nThe size of the eyes and the sclerotic rings suggests that Ophthalmosaurus hunted at a depth where there is not much light or that it may have hunted at night when a prey species was more active. Its snout was long and thin, perfect for snapping at fast, maneuverable, prey.\\n\\nCalculations suggest that a typical Ophthalmosaurus could stay submerged for approximately 20 minutes or more. The swimming speed of Ophthalmosaurus has been estimated at 2.5 metres per second or greater. Even assuming a conservative speed of 1 m/s, an Ophthalmosaurus would be able to dive to 600 meters and return to the surface within 20 minutes.\\n\\nThe family Ophthalmosauridae continued into the Upper Cretaceous, but this genus became extinct at the end of the Jurassic period.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nIchthyosaurs',\n",

These places are both cheap and convenient to shop in.\\n\\nWhen Franklins first started, their business philosophy was like Aldi\\'s: No extras, no service, no music and no electronic cash - only articles at extremely low prices or as Franklins had put it: Strictly No Frills. Because of big competition with other \"good-looking\" shops, it no longer follows this philosophy.\\n\\nFranklins is still cheap but it has more competition from other markets, such as Aldi. Today, Franklins is owned by the Pick n Pay supermarket company from the country of South Africa. It has opened Franklins Family Supermarkets in 2006, independently franchise shops of both Franklins and Pick n Pay.\\n\\nSupermarkets of Australia\\n1941 establishments in Australia',\n",

       "   'properties': {'content': 'Léo Delibes (born St. Germain-du-Val, France, 21 February 1836; died St. Germain-du-Val 16 January 1891) was a French composer of Romantic music. He is particularly famous for his ballets, especially Coppélia, and operettas and operas, of which Lakmé is the most famous.\\n\\nBiography \\nDelibes’s father worked for the post office. His mother was musical and played the piano. Her father, the composer’s grandfather, had been a baritone in the Opéra-Comique and she had a brother who was an organist and professor at the Paris Conservatoire.\\n\\nWhen Delibes’s father died in 1847 his family moved to Paris so that the young Léo, who was 11, could continue having a good musical education. At first he found it difficult living in a large city as he was used to the countryside. He was a student of the well-known composer and teacher Adolphe Adam. At first he did well in his music lessons and won prizes, but after a few years he no longer won any prizes. He never tried to win the Prix de Rome which is what all French students of composition normally want to do. As a young boy he sang in choirs. Later he became a church organist and an accompanist at the Théâtre-Lyrique.\\n\\nSoon Delibes started to composer operettas. He wrote 14 operettas in 14 years. He was commissioned to write some music to celebrate the emperor’s return from Algiers. The piece he wrote was called Alger. It was a huge success. The emperor gave him a gold medal, personally fastening a pin with diamonds to his lapel. In 1864 he became chorus master at the Opéra where he coached the chorus to sing many famous operas. Two years later he started to write ballets. These became very successful and three years later he stopped writing operettas.\\n\\nIn 1870 his ballet Coppélia was produced. By 1884 it had been performed 100 times. Together with La Sylphide and Giselle it was one of the most popular of all ballets. The story is about a man who makes a mechanical doll. Another popular ballet he wrote was Sylvia. His most successful opera was Lakmé which was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in 1883. It gives great opportunity for the main soprano, especially in the song called the Bell Song. Musicians usually think Lakmé is his greatest work.\\n\\nDelibes died in 1891, and was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre, Paris.\\n\\nReputation  \\nDelibes started to compose at a time when ballet had become less popular in France than it had been earlier. Around the time of the Revolution there had been lots of performances of ballet, but during the 19th century there was less interest with the exception of La Sylphide and Giselle. Delibes was to change that. He had a great gift for writing easy melodies. At one time he thought he ought to compose like Wagner, using richer harmonies and leitmotifs, but fortunately he chose not to, following instead the style to which he was so well suited. Coppélia is in the repertoire of all major ballet companies, and several of its tunes are familiar to people even if they do not know where they come from. \\n\\nThe Flower duet from Lakmé became particularly well known in recent years through an advert for British Airways.\\n\\n1836 births\\n1891 deaths\\nRomantic composers\\nFrench composers\\nBurials at Montmartre Cemetery, Paris',\n",

       "     'content': 'The early modern period is a term used by historians for the period in Western Europe and its first colonies which spans the three centuries between the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution.\\n\\nThe early modern period is characterized by the rise to importance of science and technological progress, civic politics and the nation state.  Capitalism began its rise, beginning in northern Italian republics such as Genoa. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of mercantilism. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of feudalism, serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church.\\n\\nThe period includes the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years\\' War, the European colonization of the Americas and the peak of the European hunt of witches.\\n\\nThe beginning of the early modern period is not clear-cut, but is generally accepted to be in the late 15th century or early 16th century. Significant dates in this phase from medieval to early modern Europe are:\\n\\n 1447\\n The invention of the first European movable type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg, a device that fundamentally changed the circulation of information. Movable type, which allowed individual characters to be arranged to form words and which is an invention separate from the printing press, had also been invented in, but not known outside of, China.\\n 1453\\n The conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans signalled the end of the Byzantine Empire; the Battle of Castillon meant the end of Hundred Years\\' War.\\n 1485\\n England\\n The last Plantagenet king, Richard III, was killed at Bosworth and the medieval civil wars of aristocratic factions gave way to early modern Tudor monarchy, in the person of Henry VII.\\n 1492\\n Spain\\n The first documented European voyage to the Americas by the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus; the end of the Reconquista, with the final expulsion of the Moors from the Iberian Peninsula; the Spanish government expels the Jews.\\n 1494\\n France\\n Italy\\n French king Charles VIII invaded Italy, so he started a series of wars which are typical for the Italian Renaissance.\\n 1513\\n First formulation of modern politics with the publication of Machiavelli\\'s The Prince.\\n 1517\\n The Reformation begins with Martin Luther nailing his ninety-five theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg, Germany.\\n 1545\\n The Council of Trent marks the end of the medieval Roman Catholic Church.\\n\\nThe end date of the early modern period is associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750, or the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, which drastically transformed the state of European politics.\\n\\nAmong the most important political changes of this time are the abolition of serfdom and the change of kingdoms into nation-states. Then the Reformation, that meant that Christendom was no unified entity any more. Many kings and rulers used this radical shift in the understanding of the world to further consolidate their sovereignty over their territories. For instance, many of the Germanic states (as well as English Reformation) converted to Protestantism in an attempt to slip out of the power of the Pope.\\n\\nThe intellectual developments of the period included the creation of the economic theory of mercantilism and the publication of works of political and social philosophy, such as Machiavelli\\'s The Prince (1513) and Thomas More\\'s Utopia (1515).\\n\\nDifference between \\'early modern\\' and the Renaissance\\n\\nThe expression \"early modern\" is sometimes, and incorrectly, used as a substitute for the term Renaissance. However, \"Renaissance\" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments; which occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe—especially central and northern Italy—and span the transition from late Medieval civilization and the opening of the early modern period.\\n\\nThe term early modern is most often applied to Europe, and its overseas empire.  However, in Japan, the Edo period from 1590 to 1868 is also sometimes referred to as the early modern period.\\n\\nPolitical powers\\n Ottoman Empire\\n Habsburg\\n Portugal\\n Great Britain\\n France\\n Early Modern Italy\\n Romania\\n Poland\\n Hungary\\n\\nRelated pages\\n Renaissance\\n\\nOther websites\\n Discussion of the medieval/modern transition from the introduction to the pioneering Cambridge Modern History (1903)\\n Society for Renaissance Studies\\n\\nHistory of Europe',\n",

       "     'content': \"Many of the most famous and best-loved works of art in the world were created during the time known as the Renaissance. The Renaissance began about 1400 and lasted until about 1600. Italy, and in particular the city of Florence is thought of as the home of Renaissance art. \\n\\nMany Flemish painters from the area of modern Belgium were also very busy at this time. The style of their pictures, and their use of oil painting influenced the Italian painters.\\n\\nImportant artworks\\n Competition for the Baptistry Doors\\nIn 1401, a competition was held to find a sculptor to make a huge set of bronze door for the oldest church in Florence. Lorenzo Ghiberti, Filippo Brunelleschi and Donatello all entered the competition. Ghiberti won. When he finished the first set of doors, he had to make another set. It took fifty years. In that time, dozens of artists helped Ghiberti to make the doors. \\n\\n Brancacci Chapel \\nOn the walls of this family chapel at the church of the Carmelite Monastery, Massaccio painted pictures which were so realistic that everyone was amazed. \\n\\n The statue of the Smug Cat \\nThe most famous sculptor of the Early Renaissance was Donatello. His most important job was to make a huge equestrian monument of a soldier (on horseback). The soldier's was called by his nickname, Gattamelata, meaning the Smug Cat (a Cat who is fed on Honey). Donatello had seen a huge equestrian monument before; there is one in Rome of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. No-one had made such a big bronze statue for more than a thousand years. Donatello's statue was a huge success. It still stands outside the Basilica of Saint Antonio, in the city of Padua. \\n\\n The painting of the Last Supper \\nLeonardo da Vinci did one of the world's most famous paintings, the Last Supper on the wall of the dining room in a monastery in Milan while he was working there for the Duke. It shows Jesus, on the night before he died, sharing a meal with his disciples. It has been reproduced and copied thousands of times. \\n\\n The Sistine Chapel Ceiling \\nMichelangelo painted the whole ceiling of the Sistine Chapel all by himself over five years. The way that the figures were painted was to influence other artists for hundreds of years.\\n\\n Mona Lisa\\nMona Lisa (also known as La Gioconda) is a 16th century portrait painted in oil on a poplar panel by Leonardo Da Vinci during the Italian Renaissance. The work is owned by the French government and hangs in the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France with the title Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo.\\n\\nThe painting is a half-length portrait and depicts a woman whose expression is often described as enigmatic. The ambiguity of the sitter's expression, the monumentality of the half-figure composition, and the subtle modeling of forms and atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the painting's continuing fascination. Few other works of art have been subject to as much scrutiny, study, mythologizing and parody.\\n\\nRelated pages \\nRenaissance architecture\\nRenaissance music\\n\\nArt\\nRenaissance\",\n",

       "     'content': 'Pop art is a modern art movement that developed in the 1950s and 60s. It was created by the Scottish sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi in London, 1952. Andy Warhol, Robert Indiana and Roy Lichtenstein are examples of pop artists.\\n\\nPop art has themes and techniques drawn from popular mass culture, such as advertising and comic books. Pop art employs images of popular as opposed to elitist culture in art.\\n\\nOrigin \\nThe Independent Group (IG), founded in London in 1951, is regarded as the starting point of the pop art movement. They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of \"fine art\". The group discussions centered on popular culture implications from such elements as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology.\\n\\nAt the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi presented a lecture using a series of collages titled Bunk! that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947–1949. This material consisted of \\'found objects\\' such as, advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics that mostly represented American popular culture. One of the images in that presentation was Paolozzi\\'s 1947 collage, I was a Rich Man\\'s Plaything, which includes the first use of the word \"pop″, appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver. After Paolozzi\\'s seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.\\n\\nMethods \\nThe artists use mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques which downplay the expressive hand of the artist.\\n\\nPop artists went for absolute clarity. Most forms were bordered with black lines as in comic books. The objects are often plain like a poster, and without perspective. The colours are clear, achromatic and primitive colours.\\n\\nObjects of the everyday life get isolated and modified or processed in collages. Pop art is a connection between reality and art, handled with abstract means. Some of their catchwords are: popular, consumable, cheap, funny and outstanding.\\n \\nMuch of pop art is rather academic, as the unconventional organizational practices used often make it difficult for some to understand. Pop art and minimalism are considered to be the last modern art movements and so the precursors to postmodern art, or some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.\\n\\nFamous pop artists \\n\\n Peter Blake\\n Jim Dine\\n James Gill\\n Red Grooms\\n Richard Hamilton\\n Keith Haring\\n\\n David Hockney\\n Robert Indiana\\n Jasper Johns\\n Roy Lichtenstein\\n John McHale\\n Claes Oldenburg\\n\\n Julian Opie\\n Eduardo Paolozzi\\n Peter Phillips\\n Pietro Psaier\\n Robert Rauschenberg\\n Larry Rivers\\n\\n James Rizzi\\n James Rosenquist\\n George Segal\\n Wayne Thiebaud \\n Andy Warhol\\n John Wesley\\n Tom Wesselmann\\n\\nReferences',\n",

       "     'content': 'The history of Europe means all the time since the beginning of written records in the European continent up to the present day. It is traditionally divided into ancient (before the fall of the Western Roman Empire) medieval, and modern (after the fall of Constantinople).\\n\\nEurope\\'s antiquity dates from the Minoan civilization, the Myceneans and later on Homer\\'s Iliad in Ancient Greece of around 700\\xa0BC. The Roman Republic was established in 509\\xa0BC, which was usurped by Octavian\\'s new Roman Empire at its first century BC peak. The Christian religion was adopted in the fourth century, and in the sixth was organized, within the Empire, by Emperor Justinian I (527–565) with five most important cities: Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. The fall of the Western Roman Empire was followed by a decline of Western Europe. The Byzantine Empire survived in the East. A new schism within the church\\'s authority in 1054 was added to the earlier division that had persisted since 451. It was followed by Crusades from west to rescue the Holy Land from Muslim invasion. Feudal society began to break down, as the Black Death spread.\\n\\nThe Fall of Constantinople in 1453 showed the military weakness of the Christians in Eastern Europe. It is often used as a starting point for modern history. Western Christians completed the Reconquista and discovered a New World in 1492. Europe awoke from the medieval period through rediscovery of classical learning, much of which had been kept alive in the Muslim world while the Western church had rejected much of it as paganry. The Renaissance was followed by the Protestant Reformation, as priest Martin Luther attacked Papal authority. The Thirty Years War, the Treaty of Westphalia and the Glorious Revolution prepared for expansion and enlightenment.\\n\\nThe Industrial Revolution, beginning in Great Britain, allowed masses of people, not just the rich, to escape for the first time from lives of being always poor and barely able to afford either food or shelter. The early British Empire split as its colonies in America revolted to establish their own representative government. Political change in continental Europe was spurred by the French Revolution, as people cried out for liberté, egalité, fraternité (liberty, equality, brotherhood). The French leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, conquered and reformed the social structure of the continent through war up to 1815, when he met his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo and was sent away into exile. As more and more small property holders were granted the vote, especially in France and the UK, socialist and trade union activity developed and revolution gripped Europe in 1848. The last vestiges of serfdom were abolished in Austria-Hungary in 1848. Russian serfdom was abolished in 1861. The Balkan nations began to regain their independence from the Ottoman Empire. After the Franco-Prussian War, Italy and Germany were formed, each from groups of smaller countries which spoke the same languages, in 1870 and 1871.\\n\\nConflict intensified across the globe, in a chase for empires, where powerful countries turned less powerful ones into colonies, until the outbreak, in 1914, of the biggest war that had ever been fought up to that point in time. It was called the Great War but now most often called World War I or the First World War. In the desperation of war, the Russian Revolution promised the people \"peace, bread and land\" and led to the end of the Russian Empire and its replacement by the formation of the Soviet Union. The defeat of Germany came at the price of economic destruction, which was formally written into the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 where it was stated that the First World War had been entirely the fault of Germany and its allies and demanded that they pay back the entire amount the war had cost.\\n\\nThe Great Depression began in 1929, brought about in part by the economic problems caused by the attempt to force Germany to pay for the war and in part by trade restrictions. Millions of people around the world lost their jobs. Governments changed in many countries, some by elections and some by revolutions. The governments soon fell into two main groups, those who believed in freedom and human rights and those who followed fascism. These two deeply different views led to a Second World War, which most people who write history feel began in Europe when Germany invaded Poland in 1939, but soon spread to most of the countries in the world. It took in wars which were already happening in other places, most notably the war between Japan and China. After this war Socialism spread to Central and Eastern Europe, including the relatively new Eastern European countries of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and in Asia North Vietnam and North Korea, and, slightly later, to Cuba in the Carribean Sea very near to North America.\\n\\nThe conflict between the advocates of a capitalist and a socialist economy and political system led to the Cold War, a forty-year argument between the United States and the Soviet Union, two of the countries which had worked together to win the Second World War and the two which had come out of it with the most powerful military forces.  They led respectively a Western Bloc and an Eastern Bloc, dividing Europe.  Each side wanted to promote their type of government.  People across the world feared a nuclear war because of the tension, and Europe, divided by the Iron Curtain, was assumed to be a probable battleground.\\n\\nCommunism became less attractive when it became clear that it could promote economic growth less effectively than the capitalistic Western states and that it was not suited for a reform that allowed freedom of speech for everyone.  Therefore, the Soviet Union forced Hungary to give up its reform in 1956, it favoured the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and it stopped reform in Czechoslovakia in 1968.  When in 1988/89 the Soviet leader Gorbachev made clear that he would not force the countries of the East block to stick to Communism the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed (1991). Then the United States was the only superpower left.\\nEurope signed a new treaty of union, which included 27 European countries in 2007.\\n\\nRelated pages\\n\\n History\\n Europe\\n European Union\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences \\n Europe: A History, by Norman Davies, published by Pimlico, \\n Illustrated History of Europe\", by Frederic Delouche, published by Henry Holt & Co \\n European History, by various authors, online book on Wikibooks\\n\\nOther websites \\n Maps of Europe at Wikimedia\\n An Atlas of European History at Wikimedia',\n",

       "     'content': 'The art of the Hellenistic time (from 400 B.C. to the end of the first century B.C.) in Greece) is sculpture and painting and other things.  For a long time, people said that the art of that time was not good.  Pliny the Elder talked about the Greek sculpture of the classical time (500 B.C. - 323 B.C., the time before the Hellenistic time) and then said Cessavit deinde ars (\"then art stopped\").  But much good art is from the Hellenistic time.  Many people   know about the sculptures Laocoön (in the picture) and Venus de Milo and Winged Victory of Samothrace.\\n\\nNow more people have looked at writing about the Hellenistic time.  People discovered art from the Hellenistic time at Vergina and other places.  Now people can see that the art of the Hellenistic time is very good art.\\n\\nArchitecture \\n\\nOne of the things that made the Hellenistic time different from other times was the division of Alexander the Great\\'s country into smaller parts.  In every part there was a family of leaders.  The Ptolemies had Egypt; the Seleucids had Mesopotamia, the Attalids had Pergamon, and other leaders had other parts.  Every family of leaders gave money for art in a way that was different from the way the city-states did it.  They made big cities and complex groups of buildings in a way that most city-states had already stopped doing by 500 BC.  This way of making buildings was new for Greece.  This way was not to try to change or fix a natural place, but to make the buildings fit the natural place.  There were many places for pleasure, for example many theatres and places to walk.  The Hellenistic countries were lucky because they had much empty space where they could make big new cities.  Some of their new cities were Antioch, Pergamon, and Seleucia on the Tigris.\\n\\nPergamon is a very good example of Hellenistic architecture.  It started with a simple fortress on the Acropolis (a very big rock).\\nDifferent Attalid kings added to it and made a huge group of buildings.  The buildings stretch out from the Acropolis in many directions, using the natural way of that part of the earth.  The agora, on the south on the lowest level, has galleries along its sides, with stoai (beautiful tall stone things to hold up the roof.) The agora is the beginning of a street which goes through the whole Acropolis.  On the east and top of the rock are the buildings of the organizers, leaders and soldiers.  On the west side, at a middle level, are religious buildings.  One of the biggest ones is the one with the Pergamon Altar which is called \"of the gods and of the giants\" and is one of the most beautiful pieces of Greek sculpture.  A very big theatre has benches stretched out over the sides of the hill, for people to sit on, and is able to hold almost 10,000 people.\\n\\nAt that time they liked to make very big things.  The second temple of Apollo at Didyma was like that.  It was twenty kilometers from Miletus in Ionia.  Daphnis of Miletus made the design for it at the end of the fourth century B.C. (about 300  B.C.) but it was never finished.  They continued building it until the 2nd century A.D. (past 100 A.D.).  The sanctuary (special part of the temple) is one of the largest ever made near the Mediterranean.  Inside a very big room, the cella has two rows of columns (tall round things) around it.  The columns are the Ionic kind, almost 20 metres tall, with much complex stone art on the bases and tops.\\n\\nSculpture \\n\\nHellenistic sculpture includes portraits which show things such as suffering, sleep or old age.  \\n\\nAttalus I (269-197 BC), to commemorate his victory at Caicus against the Gauls — called Galatians by the Greeks — had two series of votive groups sculpted:  the first, consecrated on the Acropolis of Pergamon, includes the famous Gaul killing himself and his wife, of which the original is lost (the best copy is in the  Massimo alle Terme museum of Rome, see illustration); the second group, offered to Athens, is composed of small bronzes of Greeks, Amazons, gods and giants, Persians and Gauls.  Artemis Rospigliosi of the Louvre is probably a copy of one of them;  as for copies of the Dying Gaul, they were very numerous in the Roman period.  The expression of sentiments, the forcefulness of details — bushy hair and moustaches here — and the violence of the movements are characteristic of the Pergamene style.\\n\\nThese characteristics are pushed to their peak in the friezes of the Great Altar of Pergamon, decorated under the order of Eumenes II (197-159 BC) with a gigantomachy stretching 110 metres in length, illustrating in the stone a poem composed especially for the court.  The Olympians triumph in it, each on his side, over Giants most of which are transformed into savage beasts: serpents, birds of prey, lions or bulls.  Their mother Gaia, come to their aid, can do nothing and must watch them twist in pain under the blows of the gods.\\n\\nAnother phenomenon appears in Hellenistic sculpture:  privatization, which involves the recapture of older public patterns in decorative sculpture.  This type of retrospective style also exists in ceramics.  As for the portraits, they are tinged with naturalism, under the influence of Roman art.\\n\\nPaintings and mosaics \\n\\nFew Greek wall paintings have survived the centuries.  However, we can study the Hellenistic influences in Roman frescoes, for example those of Pompeii or Herculaneum.  Certain mosaics provide a pretty good idea of the \"grand painting\" of the period:  these are copies of frescoes.  An example is the Alexander Mosaic, showing the confrontation of the young conqueror and the Grand King Darius III at the Battle of Issus, a mosaic which adorns the walls of the House of the Faun at Pompeii.  It is believed to be a copy of a work described by Pliny the Elder (XXXV, 110) which had been painted by Philoxenus of Eretria for King Cassander of Macedon at the end of the 4th century BC. The mosaic allows us to admire the choice of colours, the composition of the ensemble with turning movement and facial expressivity.\\n\\nArcheological discoveries at the cemetery of Pagasae (close to modern Volos), at the edge of the Pagasetic Gulf, or again at Vergina (1987), in the former kingdom of Macedonia, have brought to light some original works.  For example, the tomb said to be that of Philip II has provided a great frieze representing a royal lion hunt, remarkable by its composition, the arrangement of the figures in space and its realistic representation of nature.\\n\\nThe Hellenistic period is equally the time of development of the mosaic, particularly with the works of Sosos of Pergamon, active in the 2nd century BC and the only mosaic artist cited by Pliny (XXXVI, 184).  His taste for\\ntrompe l\\'oeil (optical illusion) and the effects of the medium are found in several works attributed to him such as the \"Unswept Floor\" in the Vatican museum, representing the leftovers of a repast (fish bones, bones, empty shells, etc.) and the \"Dove Basin\" at the Capitoline Museum, known by means of a reproduction discovered in Hadrian\\'s Villa.  In it one sees four doves perched on the edge of a basin filled with water.  One of them is watering herself while the others seem to be resting, which creates effects of reflections and shadow perfectly studied by the artist.\\n\\nCeramics \\n\\nThe Hellenistic period is that of the decline of painting on vases.  The most common vases are black and uniform, with a shiny appearance approaching that of varnish, decorated with simple motifs of flowers or festoons.  It is also the period when vases in relief appeared, doubtless in imitation of vases made of precious metals:  wreaths in relief were applied to the body of the vase, or again the one shown here received veins or gadroons.  One finds also more complex relief, based on animals or legendary creatures.  The shapes of the vases are also inspired by the tradition of metal:  thus with the lagynos (pictured here), a wine jar typical of the period.\\n\\nIn parallel there subsisted a tradition of polychromatic figurative painting:  the artists sought a greater variety of tints than in the past.  However, these newer colours are more delicate and do not support heat.  The painting occurred therefore after firing, contrary to the traditional practice.  The fragility of the pigments preventing frequent use of these vases, they were reserved for use in funerals.\\nThe most representative copies of this style come from Centuripe in Sicily, where a workshop was active until the 3rd century B.C.  These vases are characterized by a base painted pink. The figures, often female, are represented in coloured clothing: blue-violet chiton, yellow himation, white veil.  The style is reminiscent of Pompei and is situated much more on the side of the grand contemporary paintings than on the heritage of the red-figure pottery.\\n\\nMinor arts\\n\\nMetallic art \\n\\nProgress in bronze casting made it possible for the Greeks to create large works, such as the Colossus of Rhodes, with a height of 32 meters. Many of the large bronze statues were lost - with the majority being melted to recover the material. Because of this, only the smaller objects still exist. Fortunately, during Hellenistic Greece, the raw materials were plentiful following eastern conquests.\\n\\nThe work on metal vases took on a new fullness:  the artists competed among themselves with great virtuosity.  At Panagyurishte (now in Bulgaria), skilfully sculpted gold vases have been found: on an amphora, two rearing centaurs form the handles.  In Derveni, not far from Salonica, a tomb has provided a great krater with bronze volutes dating from approximately 320 BC and weighing 40 kilograms (Derveni krater).\\nIt is decorated with a 32-centimetre-tall frieze of figures in relief representing Dionysus surrounded by Ariadne and her procession of satyrs and maenads.\\nThe neck is decorated with ornamental motifs while four satyrs in high relief are casually seated on the shoulders of the vase. The evolution is similar for the art of jewellery.  The jewellers of the time excelled at handling details and filigrees:  thus, the funeral wreaths present very realistic leaves of trees or stalks of wheat.  In this period the insetting of precious stones flourished.\\n\\nThe figurines were equally fashionable.  They represented divinities as well as subjects from contemporary life.  Thus emerged the theme of the \"negro\", particularly in Ptolemaic Egypt: these statuettes of Black adolescents were successful up to the Roman period.  Sometimes, they were reduced to echoing a form from the great sculptures:  thus one finds numerous copies in miniature of the Tyche (good luck) of Antioch, of which the original dates to the beginning of the 3rd century BC.\\n\\nTerra cotta figurines \\n\\nPreviously reserved for religious use, in Hellenistic Greece the Greek terracotta figurine was more frequently used for funerary, and even decorative, purposes. The refinement of molding techniques made it possible to create true miniature statues, with a high level of detail.\\n\\nIn Tanagra, in Boeotia, the figurines, full of lively colours, most often represent elegant women in scenes full of charm.  At Smyrna, in Asia Minor, two major styles occurred side-by-side: first of all, copies of masterpieces of great sculpture, such as Farnese Hercules in gilt terra cotta.  In a completely different genre, there are the \"grotesques\", which contrast violently with the canons of \"Greek beauty\": the koroplathos (figurine maker) fashions deformed bodies in tortuous poses — hunchbacks, epileptics, hydrocephalics, obese women, etc.  One could therefore wonder whether these were medical models, the town of Smyrna being reputed for its medical school. Or they could simply be caricatures, designed to provoke laughter. The \"grotesques\" are equally common at Tarsus and also at Alexandria.\\n\\nArt of glass and glyptic \\n\\nIt was in the Hellenistic period that the Greeks, who until then only knew molded glass, discovered the technique of glass blowing, thus permitting new forms. The art of glass developed especially in Italy. Molded glass continued, notably in the creation of intaglio jewelry.\\n\\nThe art of engraving on gems hardly advanced at all, limiting itself to mass-produced items that lacked originality. As compensation, the cameo made its appearance. It concerns cutting in relief on a stone composed of several colored layers, allowing the object to be presented in relief through the effects of color.  After that it is mounted on a pendant or as a ring.  The Hellenistic period produced some masterpieces like the Gonzaga cameo , now preserved at the Hermitage Museum.\\n\\nRelated pages\\n Winged Victory of Samothrace\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n Selection of Hellenistic works at the British Museum\\n Selection of Hellenistic works at the Louvre\\n Hellenistic Art , Insecula.com\\n\\nArt\\nAncient Greece',\n",

His paintings of that time express exuberance at city life. In his final painting, Broadway Boogie Woogie (painted around 1942 or 1943), the checkerboard lines, previously black, are now painted blue, gray, red and yellow.

       "     'content': 'Art films are a type of movie that is very different from the popular Hollywood blockbuster movies. Art films have many other names. Some people call them art movies, independent films, indie films, arthouse films, auteur films (\"auteur\" is a French word which means \"author\") or experimental films. \\n\\nArt films are usually made by smaller movie companies. These companies do not have much money compared to the Major movie studios large movie studios, for example, Paramount or Disney. Art films usually have different plots (stories) than blockbuster movies. They usually tell more creative or unusual stories than blockbuster movies.  \\n\\nArt films often show controversial or sad stories. These types of movies may have sad endings. They are sometimes hard to understand, because the movie may be about people\\'s feelings, thoughts, or dreams.  \\n\\nFor these reasons, art films are not shown in many cinemas or theaters.  They do not have large audiences and do not make much money.  They are generally promoted by word of mouth.  People see the movie and then tell their friends to go see it.\\n\\nA comparison of an art movie and a blockbuster movie\\nThe opposite of an art film is a popular blockbuster movie.  Blockbuster movies have famous actors and large budgets.  Some have expensive special effects.  They are made so that millions of people will pay money to see the movie. \\n\\nBlockbuster movies are part of the reason why people make art films.  Movie directors making art films try to make them very different from blockbuster movies.  The movie is a more personal statement by the director.  Blockbusters are made for commercial reasons and art films are made for personal reasons. \\n\\nThe large budgets of blockbuster movies are not only to make the movie.  The money also pays for advertisements. Art movies have small budgets. They usually have unknown or little-known actors. Some even use amateur actors. Some art films will even use regular people with no experience as actors to work as the actors. It is not uncommon for Art film directors to use friends and family members as actors. \\n\\nBlockbusters often use simple stories and characters that have been used before in other movies. Art movies usually use strange or unusual stories and characters that the audience may not have seen before.\\n\\nIn blockbuster movies, there is usually a happy ending. All of the problems in the story are figured out or fixed by the end of the movie. In art movies, there is often a sad ending. They can also have endings which are either hard to understand or could mean many different things. These endings are used so that the audience will have to think about what might have happened in the story. \\n\\nBlockbuster movies have a large amount of television advertising, billboards and internet sites. Art films often have little or no advertising.\\n\\nBlockbuster movies are very popular. This causes more movies to be made using the same story and characters. For example, the James Bond movies all tell stories about the British spy named James Bond. The Star Wars science fiction movies all tell stories about spaceships and outer space wars. Art films are very rarely made into franchises with sequels. This is because directors of art films are often trying to create a new movie with new ideas for each movie they make. Some art films do have sequels. This will most often happen when the movie was very well liked and the director wanted to tell more stories using some of the same characters.\\n\\nArt film becomes Hollywood franchise \\nRarely, an art film can be so well liked that a franchise is created because of it. The View Askew universe is an example of this. Kevin Smith wrote and directed the movie Clerks. He produced the movie himself with a friend, Scott Mosier. They named their production company, View Askew Productions.  This movie was an art film. It had a small budget, dealt with personal issues and its actors were mainly Smith\\'s friends and family. Smith even played one of the characters himself. The movie was very popular and sold well when it was released on DVD. Universal Pictures, a large Hollywood studio, asked him to make a movie for them. He used two of his characters from Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob, as part of the new movie. He later used Jay (played by Jason Mewes and Silent Bob (played by Smith) is three other movies he wrote: Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks 2, a sequel to Clerks.\\n\\nWhy are art movies different from regular movies?\\nDavid Bordwell is a professor from the United States. He studies movies at a university. He thought of a way of explaining what an \"art film\" is in 1979. He wrote that art films are different from regular Hollywood movies. Regular Hollywood movies have a clear story and plot. Art film often have much stranger stories. In an art film, the stories may be hard to understand. As well, in an art film, the audience may have a hard time understanding what is going on. Art movies are often about people\\'s feelings and thoughts. Art movies are often about big questions that a person has to answer about who they are or what they should do in a situation.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nMovies',\n",

It tries to make rock music into art instead of just entertainment. It often uses longer songs than other genres of rock. It uses different techniques such as elements (parts) of classical music. It is not usually music to dance to, but music to just listen to. It started in the 1960s. Phil Spector (an American music producer) and Brian Wilson (the leader of The Beach Boys) are two early examples of musicians making art rock.

The product of art is called a work of art, for others to experience.\\n\\nSome art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay bowl that can be used. That kind of art is sometimes called a craft.\\n\\nThose who make art are called artists. They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it. Some people find art relaxing, exciting or informative. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity.\\n\\n\"The arts\" is a much broader term. It includes drawing, painting, sculpting, photography, performance art, dance, music, poetry, prose and theatre.\\n\\nTypes of art \\n\\nArt is divided into the plastic arts, where something is made, and the performing arts, where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.\\n\\n Plastic art\\n Fine art is expression by making something beautiful or appealing to the emotions by visual means: drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture\\n Literature: poetry, creative writing\\n Performing art\\n Performing art including drama are (expression using the body: dance, acting, singing)\\n Auditory art (expression by making sounds): music, singing\\n Practical art\\n Culinary art (expression by making flavors and tastes): cooking\\n The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: architecture, filming, fashion, photography, video games)\\n\\nWhat \"art\" means \\nSome people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind, spirit and soul.  An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it. Some people also get inspired.\\n\\nThe first and broadest sense of \"art\" means \"arrangement\" or \"to arrange.\" In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.\\n\\nArt may express emotion.  Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them.  Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience.  However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.\\n\\nHistory of art \\nThere are sculptures, cave painting and rock art dating from the Upper Paleolithic era.\\n\\nAll of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt, India, China, Greece, Rome and Persia had works and styles of art. In the Middle Ages, most of the art in Europe showed people from the Bible in paintings, stained glass windows, and mosaic tile floors and walls.\\n\\nIslamic art includes geometric patterns, Islamic calligraphy, and architecture. In India and Tibet, painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included jade carving, bronze, pottery, poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.\\n\\nIn Europe, after the Middle Ages, there was a \"Renaissance\" which means \"rebirth\". People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented perspective where things in the distance look smaller in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other. These artists used nudity regularly in their art.\\n\\nIn the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism, Romanticism, Realism, and Impressionism. The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, and Minimalism.\\n\\nRoles of art \\nIn some societies, people think that art belongs to the person who made it. They think that the artist put his or her \"talent\" and industry into the art. In this view, the art is the property of the artist, protected by copyright.\\n\\nIn other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artist\\'s work. In this view, society is a collective that has made the art, through the artist.\\n\\nFunctions of art \\nThe functions of art include:\\n\\n1) Cognitive function\\n\\n Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.\\n\\n2) Aesthetic function\\n\\n Works of art can make people happy by being beautiful.\\n\\n3) Prognostic function\\n\\n Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...\\n\\n4) Recreation function\\n\\n Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.\\n\\n5) Value function\\n\\n What did the artist value?

       "     'content': 'Pictures at an Exhibition is a piece of music for solo piano composed by Modest Mussorgsky in 1874.  It is Mussorgsky’s most famous solo piano work and often played by virtuosos to show how good they are.  Many years after Mussorgsky’s death, Maurice Ravel made an arrangement of the piece for orchestra.  This version, by a Russian composer and a French arranger, is how people usually hear the music today.\\n\\nComposition history\\n\\nPictures at an Exhibition is a musical description of an exhibition of pictures by the painter Viktor Hartmann.  Hartmann was only 39 when he died in 1873.  He and Mussorgsky had been good friends.  They both tried to give their works a very Russian character: Hartmann through his pictures and Mussorgsky through his music.  In 1874 an exhibition of Hartmann’s pictures was organised in the Academy of Fine Arts in St Petersburg.  Mussorgsky went to the exhibition and was inspired to compose his piano piece.  \\n\\nPictures at an Exhibition describes someone walking round the exhibition and looking at the pictures.  The ten pictures he describes in music were drawings and watercolours.  Mussorgsky starts his piece with a tune which describes the person walking round the exhibition.  It is usually known as the “promenade” theme (a promenade is a walk).   At first Mussorgsky puts the promenade theme between each picture, but he does not do that all the way through the piece.  Some of the later pictures have bits of the promenade theme in the music.\\n\\nPublication history \\n\\nMussorgsky composed the piece very quickly. It was not published until 1886, five years after the composer’s death.  The composer’s great friend Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov published it, but he made some changes to what Mussorgsky had written.  It was not until 1931 that an edition was published which tried to show exactly what Mussorgsky had written.\\n\\nGallery of Hartmann’s pictures \\n\\nFour of the pictures that Mussorgsky described in his music:\\n\\nDescription of the music\\nThe  Promenade  theme describes a person walking round the exhibition.  It has lots of important-sounding chords.  Mussorgsky wrote it with a time signature of 11/4, although it is usually written nowadays in 5/4 and 6/4 time.  \\n \\n\\nThese are the ten pictures which are then described in Mussorgsky’s music:\\n\\n No. 1 \"Gnomus\" : This describes a little gnome with crooked legs trying to run around. Hartmann’s sketch may be a drawing of a toy nutcracker.\\n\\n No. 2 \"The Old Castle\" describes an old medieval castle.  A troubadour is singing a song in front of the castle.  It is a gentle, rather sad song.  In Ravel’s version for orchestra the tune is played on the alto saxophone.\\n\\n No. 3 \"Tuileries\"  describes children playing in a park called Tuileries which is in the centre of Paris. It has a little tune which sounds like children singing a teasing song.\\n\\n No. 4 \"Bydło\" describes a  cart which is being pulled by oxen.  In Ravel’s orchestral version the tune is played by the tuba.  It sounds very low and heavy.\\n\\n No. 5 The Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks\"  describes little canary chicks which are still in their eggs.  The picture was based on a ballet which had been produced in 1870.\\n\\n No. 6 \"Samuel Goldenberg und Schmuÿle\" describes two Jews.

       "     'content': 'Postmodernism is a way of thinking about culture, philosophy, art and many other things. The term has been used in many different ways at different times, but there are some things in common.\\n\\nPostmodernism says that there is no real truth. It says that knowledge is always made or invented and not discovered. Because knowledge is made by people, a person cannot know something with certainty - all ideas and facts are \\'believed\\' instead of \\'known\\'. People believe that they know what the truth is, but they will think that the truth is something different later. This is the opposite of \\'objectivity\\', which says that the truth is always there and people have to discover it.\\n\\nSince postmodernism says that the truth is just a thing that people invent, people can believe different things and think it is the truth and all be right. Postmodernism says that one person should not try to make another person believe what he believes, because it means nothing to say that one belief is right and the other is wrong. Postmodernism says that if somebody has a belief and tries to make somebody else believe it also, it means that they are just trying to have power over them.\\n\\nStarting with the 18th century Enlightenment and into the early 20th century, many people believed that science and new knowledge would make the world better. When scientists or philosophers discovered something new, it would always make society a little bit better. They thought that social progress could not be stopped. Modernism especially believed this. But postmodernism says that there is no real social progress. It says that while some things about the world change, people only want to believe that the world is better than it was. It changes but does not get better, because there is no \\'better.\\'\\n\\nPostmodernism says that since peoples\\' opinions change, and since one person\\'s opinion cannot be more right than another, it means nothing to say that (for example) one work of art is better than any other. Postmodernism says that art, music, and literature, for example, can be anything that its maker says that it is. Postmodern art and literature commonly talk about themselves and make fun of themselves. They make fun of \\'serious\\' art and even the idea of art. Postmodernism has influenced many cultural fields, including literary criticism, philosophy, sociology, linguistics, architecture, visual arts, and music.\\n\\nThe term postmodernism was first commonly used in the 1949 to talk about modern architecture. Many people did not like modern architecture because it had too many box-like shapes and people did not think it was pretty. Some of them started the postmodern architecture movement. Postmodern architecture uses surface ornament, historical reference, and less box-like shapes.\\n\\nPostmodernist ideas can be seen in philosophy, the study of culture and society, literature, architecture, design, as well as in history and law. Postmodernism also led people to think differently about love, marriage, popular culture, and the change in much of the Western world from an industrial to service economy.  \\n\\nThe term postmodernity usually means the period of time when postmodern ideas became common (the second half of the 20th century). Some experts think that postmodernism is now over, especially in literature.\\n\\nDifferent definitions\\nThe term \"Postmodernism\" is often used to refer to different, sometimes contradictory (they cannot both be right) concepts. Common definitions are:\\n\\nCompact Oxford English Dictionary: \"a style and concept in the arts characterized by distrust of theories and ideologies and by the drawing of attention to conventions\".\\nMerriam-Webster: Either \"of, relating to, or being an era after a modern one\", or \"of, relating to, or being any of various movements in reaction to modernism that are typically characterized by a return to traditional materials and forms (as in architecture) or by ironic self-reference and absurdity (as in literature)\", or finally \"of, relating to, or being a theory that involves a radical reappraisal of modern assumptions about culture, identity, history, or language\".\\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary: \"Of or relating to art, architecture, or literature that reacts against earlier modernist principles, as by reintroducing traditional or classical elements of style or by carrying modernist styles or practices to extremes: \\'It [a roadhouse] is so architecturally interesting ... with its postmodern wooden booths and sculptural clock.\\'\"\\n\\nBecause the term postmodernism can be used to talk about so many different things and can mean many different things, some people say that it is only a buzzword that means nothing. Dick Hebdige, in his book ‘Hiding in the Light’, writes:\\n\\n\"When it becomes possible for a people to describe as ‘postmodern’ the décor of a room, the design of a building, the diegesis of a film, the construction of a record, or a ‘scratch’ video, a television commercial, or an arts documentary, or the ‘intertextual’ relations between them, the layout of a page in a fashion magazine or critical journal, an anti-teleological tendency within epistemology, the attack on the ‘metaphysics of presence’, a general attenuation of feeling, the collective chagrin and morbid projections of a post-War generation of baby boomers confronting disillusioned middle-age, the ‘predicament’ of reflexivity, a group of rhetorical tropes, a proliferation of surfaces, a new phase in commodity fetishism, a fascination for images, codes and styles, a process of cultural, political or existential fragmentation and/or crisis, the ‘de-centring’ of the subject, an ‘incredulity towards metanarratives’, the replacement of unitary power axes by a plurality of power/discourse formations, the ‘implosion of meaning’, the collapse of cultural hierarchies, the dread engendered by the threat of nuclear self-destruction, the decline of the university, the functioning and effects of the new miniaturised technologies, broad societal and economic shifts into a ‘media’, ‘consumer’ or ‘multinational’ phase, a sense (depending on who you read) of ‘placelessness’ or the abandonment of placelessness (‘critical regionalism’) or (even) a generalised substitution of spatial for temporal coordinates - when it becomes possible to describe all these things as ‘Postmodern’ (or more simply using a current abbreviation as ‘post’ or ‘very post’) then it’s clear we are in the presence of a buzzword\".\\n\\nBritish historian Perry Anderson says that postmodernism is an important concept and is important for the study of contemporary (current) culture.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther sources \\nBullock, Alan & Trombly, Stephen. 1988.

       "     'content': 'Cubism was one of the most significant art movements of the 20th century. It began in France about 1907, and flourished from 1910 through the 1920s. It was pioneered by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso.\\n\\nPablo Picasso\\'s 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d\\'Avignon was an early Cubist work. Georges Braque\\'s 1908 Houses at L’Estaque (and related works) prompted the critic Louis Vauxcelles to refer to \"bizarreries cubiques\" (cubic oddities).\\n\\nThe first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris in the spring of 1911. It included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, but no works by Picasso and Braque were exhibited.\\n\\nAccording to one art historian, there were three phases of Cubism. There was \"Early Cubism\", (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed by Picasso and Braque. In the second phase, \"High Cubism\", (from 1909 to 1914), Juan Gris emerged as an important exponent after 1911. Finally \"Late Cubism\" (from 1914 to 1921) was the last phase of Cubism as a radical avant-garde movement. Douglas Cooper\\'s emphasis on the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and Léger (to a lesser extent) was an intentional value judgement.\\n\\nIts methods \\nCubism is a style of art which aims to show all of the possible viewpoints of a person or an object all at once. It is called Cubism because the items represented in the artworks look like they are made out of cubes and other geometrical shapes. Cubism was first started by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Analytical Cubism is the first type of cubism. Most analytical Cubists painted and drew in monochrome (only one colour) so that the person who was looking at the painting did not pay attention to colour, but only to the shapes and the forms that were being shown.\\n\\nThis was changed in 1912 when Picasso first started painting with colours and using collages. Collage is when you glue together different cut-up pieces of paper to make an artwork. This new form of Cubism was called Synthetic Cubism. Picasso invented collage because he was tired of the way he was making his art, and wanted to try out something new.\\nPablo Picasso created over 20,000 pictures. From 1912 to 1919 was Picasso\\'s Synthetic Cubism Period.\\n\\nReferences\\nTypes of Cubism\\n\\nThere were two main types of Cubism:\\n\\n Analytical Cubism - The first stage of the Cubism movement was called Analytical Cubism. In this style, artists would study (or analyze) the subject and break it up into different blocks. They would look at the blocks from different angles. Then they would reconstruct the subject, painting the blocks from various viewpoints.\\n\\n Synthetic Cubism - The second stage of Cubism introduced the idea of adding in other materials in a collage. Artists would use colored paper, newspapers, and other materials to represent the different blocks of the subject. This stage also introduced brighter colors and a lighter mood to the art.\\n\\nArt movements',\n",

       "     'content': 'Impressionism is a style of painting which began in France in the late 19th century. Impressionist painting shows life-like subjects painted in a broad, rapid style, with brushstrokes that are easily seen and colours that are often bright. The term \\'impressionism\\' comes from a painting by Claude Monet, which he showed in an exhibition with the name Impression, soleil levant (\"Impression, Sunrise\"). An art critic called Louis Leroy saw the exhibition and wrote a review in which he said that all the paintings were just \"impressions\". \\n\\nImpressionist painters are mostly known for their work in oil paint on canvas. Some impressionist painters also made watercolours and prints. There is also some impressionist sculpture.\\n\\nHistory \\n\\nIn the 19th century, most artists learned to paint by attending an art school or academy. The academies were very strict about the way that young artists learnt to paint. The popular style of painting was called classicism. Classical paintings were always done inside a studio. They often showed stories from mythology. An artist would prepare for a painting by doing lots of drawings. The paintings were very smoothly and carefully painted.\\n\\nAt the same time there were several painters who loved to paint the French landscape and the village people in a realist way, different from Classicism. They would often make small quick paintings out of doors, and then finish them in the studio. These artists include Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste Corot. Edgar Degas wrote in 1883: \"There is one master, Corot. We are nothing in comparison, nothing\". A group of young painters who admired the work of these artists became friends and started painting together. These artists were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin.\\n\\nEvery year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the Salon de Paris. In 1863 an artist called Edouard Manet put a picture into the show called Lunch on the Grass (\"Le déjeuner sur l\\'herbe\"). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman\\'s dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute! The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude). Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the Salon des Refusés which showed all the pictures that had been \"refused\". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new \"movement\" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to. \\n \\nIn 1872 Monet and his friends formed a society called the \"Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\". They began to organize their own art show. In 1874 thirty artists held their first exhibition. The critic Louis Leroy made fun of their work and wrote an article called The Exhibition of the Impressionists. The public who came to the exhibition also began to use this name. The painters themselves soon started to use the name \"Impressionists\" and they have been called by that name ever since. They had eight exhibitions between 1874 and 1886. They paid a dealer called Paul Durand-Ruel to organise exhibitions, and he arranged shows in London and New York. Bit by bit, their paintings became popular. Some of the Impressionists, Monet and Renoir, lived to be old and famous, but others died very poor. The main artists who are called \"Impressionists\" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, Armand Guillaumin, Mary Cassatt, Gustave Caillebotte and Frederic Bazille.\\n\\nMany artists worked with the Impressionists for a short time, but then began to try out new ideas. These artists all painted in different ways, but together are called the Post-Impressionists. They include Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Vincent van Gogh.\\n\\nWhile the French Impressionist painters were at work in France, painters in other countries were also beginning to paint outdoors in a broader style. Eventually the Impressionist style spread to many countries across Europe, to North America and Australia. Some artists continued to paint in the Impressionist style right through the 20th century.\\n\\nSubject and style\\n\\nImpressionism and photography \\nBefore the time of the Impressionists, many artists worked by painting portraits. Before the invention of the camera, painted portraits were the main way to record a person\\'s \"appearance\" (what they looked like). But by the time the Impressionists started painting, there were many photographers who had studios where people could go to be photographed. As cameras improved, photographers started taking \"snapshots\" of scenery and people outdoors.\\n\\nPhotography had two effects on painters. Firstly, it meant that it was much harder for them to live by painting portraits. Many artists became very poor. Secondly, the image taken by a camera often has interesting angles and viewpoints that are not usually painted by artists. Impressionist painters were able to learn from photographs. Many Impressionist paintings make the viewer feel as if they were right there, looking at the scene through the eyes of the artist.\\n\\nSubjects \\nImpressionist painters did not paint from their imagination, from literature, history or mythology like most other painters of the 19th century. They painted what they saw in the world around them: the town where they lived, the landscape where they went on holiday, their family, their friends, their studios and the things that were around their home. Sometimes they were \"commissioned\" (given a job) to paint a portrait of someone.\\n\\nImpressionist painters liked to paint \"ordinary\" things that were part of everyday life. They painted women doing the washing and ironing, ballet dancers doing exercises, horses getting ready for a race and a bored-looking waitress serving a customer. Nobody, before the Impressionists, had ever thought that these subjects were interesting enough to paint.\\n\\nEven though many Impressionist artists painted people, they are thought of mainly for their landscape painting. Impressionist painters were not satisfied with doing some drawings or quick painted sketches outdoors and then making grand pictures in the studio. Impressionist painters were not satisfied with painting the shape of the land, the buildings and trees. They wanted to capture the light and the weather.\\n\\nTechnique \\nThe Impressionist painters looked for a \"technique\" (a way of doing something) to paint landscapes that showed the light and the weather. The light and the weather change all the time. The light of the sun on the landscape changes every minute as the Earth turns. Impressionist painters looked at the works of earlier French artists such as Camille Corot and Gustave Courbet. Courbet often took his paints outdoors and made quick coloured sketches that he could then use to make large paintings in his studio. The Impressionist painters were more interested in the sketches than the finished paintings. \\n\\nAnother artist, Eugene Boudin, used to sit on the beach at Deauville with his oil paints, and make quick paintings of the people on holiday. They would sometimes buy his paintings as souvenirs.\\n\\nClaude Monet met Boudin and learnt that the only way to \"capture\" the way that a landscape looked at a particular time was to paint small pictures, very quickly, and without bothering to mix the paints up to make nice smooth even colours. Impressionist painters would use big brushstrokes of different bright colours and let them get mixed up on the canvas, instead of carefully mixing them up on a palette first. By painting in this way, without bothering with the details, Impressionist painters capture a realistic \"impression\" of a the world that they saw around them.\\n\\nSome of the things that they painted were: snow gently falling over a town, mist rising on a river in the pink morning light, people walking through a field of wheat with bright red poppies growing in it, sunlight dappling through leaves onto people dancing, a train sending up clouds of smoke in a big railway station, and water lillies floating on a pool under drooping willows.\\n\\nMost Impressionist landscape paintings are small, so that the artist could carry them outdoors. Some artists, particularly Claude Monet, would take several canvases, and as the day went on and the light changed, he would put down one and take up another. He rented a room from which he could see Rouen Cathedral so that he could paint it from the window at different times of day. Monet also did a series of Haystack paintings, showing them standing in the field from different angles and in all sorts of weather, bright sunshine, morning frost and snow. Paintings that are done outdoors are called \"plein air\" paintings. The Impressionist painters often used to go out together on painting trips, so there are many pictures that can be compared.\\n\\nOther impressionist art forms \\nThe term \"impressionism\" has been used for other forms of art, such as writing and music. Octave Mirbeau is often described as an impressionist writer. In 1887, music critics said the works of Claude Debussy were impressionist. Later, other composers were also described as impressionist, including Maurice Ravel, Paul Dukas, Erik Satie and Albert Roussel.\\n\\nGallery of impressionist paintings \\nClick on each image to enlarge it, to see the way each artist has used brush-strokes and colour.\\n\\nCapturing the scene\\n\\nSeeing like a camera\\n\\nPeople outdoors\\n\\nChanging seasons in the town\\n\\nLight on water\\n\\nTimeline: Lives of the Impressionists\\nThe Impressionists\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Post-impressionists\\n Neo-impressionism\\n Pointillism\\n Expressionism \\n Fauvism \\n Cubism\\n Impressionist music\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nMore reading \\n Helen Gardner, Art through the Ages, Harcourt, Brace and World, Inc. \\n Jurgen Schultze, Art of Nineteenth-Century Europe, Abrams, (1979)  \\n Nathaniel Harris, The Impressionists, Viscount Books, (1984)',\n",

This was a collaborative work by Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie, Pablo Picasso and Léonide Massine. The program notes ran:\\n\"From this new alliance... there has come about, in Parade, a kind of super-realism (\\'sur-réalisme\\'), in which I see the starting point of a series of manifestations of this new spirit\".\\n\\nThe movement grew out of Dadaism. This was, amid the horrors of World War I, a protest at the meaninglessness of civilised life.\\n\\nAt the same time, the work of Sigmund Freud began to filter through, and affect the literary and art worlds. André Breton was trained in psychiatry, and during the war, he worked in a hospital where he used Freud\\'s methods on shell-shock patients. Not surprisingly, Breton influenced many writers and artists after the war.\\n\\nFreud\\'s work placed emphasis on the subconscious mind, and its role in steering behaviour and emotion. His way of using free association, and dream analysis to get a clue to the subconscious was picked up by the surrealists. They painted dreamlike fantasies, and practised automatic drawing without sight: \\'automatism\\'.\\n\\nIn 1924, Breton wrote a Surrealist Manifesto, which defined surrealism as:\\n\"Psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express -- verbally, by means of the written word, or in any other manner -- the actual functioning of thought. Dictated by the thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern\".\\n\\nBreton discussed his first encounter with the surreal, in a description of a hypnagogic state, in which a strange phrase inexplicably appeared in his mind: There is a man cut in two by the window. This phrase illustrates Breton\\'s view of Surrealism as two distant realities brought together to create a new, uncanny union.\\n\\nSurrealist works have an element of surprise: unexpected items are placed next to each other for no clear reason. Many Surrealist artists and writers see their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost. The works are an artifact, and André Breton said that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement. From the 1920s in Paris it spread around the globe. It influenced films such as the Angel\\'s Egg and El Topo.\\n\\nTRANSCENDENTAL SURREALISM Is a new artistic approach, that stands as\\xa0 the evolution and redefinition of Surrealism in its classical form, as it became internationally known by Andre Bretton\\'s Manifest in the early 20th century. Transcendental Surrealism in Visual Arts, presented in 2018 by the greek visual artist - architect Giorgios (Gio) Vassiliou (b. 1970). It is based on a completely new theory and philosophy that is summarized in\\xa0 three new foundamental  elements, that follow the evolution of ideas, that have emerged so far during the 21st century, in Visual Arts, Psychology, Physics, and the visual perception of the physical world. These three new foundamental elements are: \\n\\na) Transcendental perception \\n\\nb) Creative imagination\\n\\nc) Slow current of thought\\n\\nArtists \\nMax Ernst, Salvador Dali, Man Ray, André Masson, Joan Miró and Marcel Duchamp were some of the best-known surrealist artists.\\n\\nBooks \\n Baznani, Achraf.

Colours and shapes are not used in a way people see them, but as the artist feels them. \\n\\nExpressionism emerged as an \\'avant-garde movement\\' in poetry and painting before the First World War. In the Weimar years it was appreciated by a mass audience, peaking in popularity in 1920s Berlin.\\n\\nExpressionism presents the world as subjective: how the artist feels it, not how it is scientifically. The art looks to get an emotional effect, and transmits personal moods and ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of \"being alive\" and emotional experience rather than physical reality.\\n\\nExpressionism is exhibited in many art forms, including: painting, literature, theatre, dance, film, architecture and music. The term often implies emotional angst. In a general sense, painters such El Greco could be called expressionist; in practice, the term is applied only to 20th century works.\\n\\nThe Expressionist stress on the individual perspective was also a reaction to positivism and other artistic movements such as naturalism and impressionism.\\n\\nTypical modern expressionists are Edvard Munch (The Scream), August Macke, Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner, Emil Nolde, Marc Chagall,  and others.

       "     'content': 'The Dome of Florence Cathedral\\nFlorence Cathedral, (called il Duomo), built by Arnolfo di Cambio, had a huge hole at the centre. The competition to build a roof over it was won by Brunelleschi who built the largest dome since Roman times. He cleverly got the whole city excited by getting teams of workers from the eight parts of the city. \\n\\nChurch of San Lorenzo \\nThis church in Florence was designed by Brunelleschi using all the things he had learnt by looking at the architecture of Ancient Rome. It has arches, columns and round-topped windows in the Roman style. It looks completely different to the pointy-arched churches of the Middle Ages. Only the inside was finished. The outside is still all rough bricks and no-on knows exacly how it was meant to look. On the inside, however, Brunelleschi taught everyone a new set of architectural rule that revolutionised The Renaissance.\\n\\nChurch of Sant\\' Andrea \\nWhen the Ancient Roman Emperors came back from winning a battle, they built a Triumphal Arch as a monument to themself. There are several of these monuments in Rome and they have the same design: a big arch at the centre, and a smaller lower arch or doorway on either side. The architect Alberti used this as the design for the front of the church of Sant\\' Andrea in Mantua. He used the same pattern of tall and arched, low and square, all down the inside of the church as well. This was copied by many other architects. \\n\\nMedici-Riccardi Palace \\nWhen it came to building palaces, the rich people of the Renaissance had different needs to the Roman Emperors, so the architects had to use the rules to make a new sort of grand building. These Renaissance palaces are usually three stories high and quite plain on the outside. On the inside there is a courtyard, surrounded by beautiful columns and windows. Architects like Michelozzo who worked for Cosimo de\\' Medici, looked at the Roman Colisseum (sports arena) which is three stories high with rows of arches. \\n https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Florence_Medici_Riccardi_Palace.jpg  \\nSaint Peter\\'s Basilica\\nThe most famous church in Rome was the ancient Church that had been built over the grave of St. Peter. By 1500 it was falling down. The Pope decided that instead of repairing it, it should be pulled down and a brand new church should be built. By the time it was finished, lots of important artists had worked on the design including Michelangelo, Raphael, Bramante, Maderna and Sangallo. It was the first building to use huge columns called a \"giant order\". It has one of the most magnificent domes in the world. It has been copied in many countries. \\n\\nVilla Rotunda \\nThis country house was built by Palladio in 1550. It is a square building which looks the same from every side. At the centre, there is a dome. On every side is a large porch, (portico), like a Greek temple. It is such an elegant design that other architects used the same style which can be seen on churches, houses and palaces, including the White House.\\n\\nArchitecture\\nRenaissance',\n",

       "     'content': 'The Renaissance is a period in European history that followed the Middle Ages and ended in the 17th century. “Renaissance” is a French word for “rebirth.” During this period, there was a “rebirth” of classical learning. People started relearning the teachings of scholars from Ancient Greece, Rome, and other ancient societies. The Renaissance is often said to be the start of the \"modern age\".\\n\\nDuring the Renaissance, there were many advances in art, literature, the sciences, mathematics, and culture. Many famous artists, writers, philosophers, and scientists lived during this period. A person who is clever at a great number of things is sometimes called a \"Renaissance man\". The most famous Renaissance man is Leonardo da Vinci, who was a painter, a scientist, a musician and a philosopher.\\n\\nThe Renaissance started in Italy, but soon spread across the whole of Europe. In Italy, the period is divided into three parts: \\n the Early Renaissance\\n the High Renaissance \\n the Late Renaissance  <ref></ref> (also called the Mannerist period)\\n\\nFollowing the Mannerist period was the Baroque period, which also spread across Europe starting around 1600. Outside Italy, it can be hard to tell where the Renaissance period ends and the Baroque begins.\\n\\n Causes of the Renaissance  \\n\\n Reading and printing \\nIn the Middle Ages, most artistic, legal, and historical production took place in and around books. Monasteries, churches, universities, and people who could afford them produced and owned books. Books were produced entirely by hand, which is why they were called manuscripts; illuminated manuscripts include hand-colored, drawn, and gilded pictures. \\n\\nMost books at that time were written in Latin, Greek, and Roman, which was used in the Catholic Church. Only priests and well-educated people read Latin then. People were forbidden by law from translating the Bible into Italian, English, German, French, or other \"local\" languages.\\n\\nAround 1440 the first printed books were made in Europe. The printing press made it possible to print copies of large books like the Bible and sell them cheaply. It took 300 calf skins or 100 pig skins to print the Bible. Printers soon began to print everything that they thought was interesting: Ancient Greek and Roman writings, poetry, and plays; stories about the lives of the saints; mathematics textbooks; medical textbooks; Christian stories; erotic stories; books about animals and monsters; maps of the world; and advice to princes about how to rule their people.\\n\\nBefore the invention of the printing press, knowledge had belonged to priests, monasteries and universities.  Suddenly many thousands of people, even merchants, could learn far more than they ever could before. \\n\\n Ancient Roman remainings \\nFrom about 400 B.C. to about 400 AD, Europe experienced a Golden Age. In Ancient Greece and Rome, there were many philosophers, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and mathematicians. Things were beautiful, well-organised and well-run.\\n\\nHowever, by the year 1400, the city of Rome was in ruins. Inside the broken walls that had been smashed in 410 AD were the remains of huge temples, sports arenas, public baths, apartment blocks and palaces. Nearly all of them were half-buried and ruined, so they could not be used. Many were pulled down to use as building stone. \\n\\nAmong the ruins of this once-great city, the people of Rome lived in cottages. They still went to church in the huge churches (basilicas) built by the first Christian Emperor, Constantine the Great, in the 4th century. They still held market day in the Ancient Roman market place of Campo dei Fiori (\"Field of Flowers\").\\n\\nIn 1402, Filippo Brunelleschi and a teenage Donatello came to Rome. They were probably the world\\'s first archaeologists. They were fascinated by everything that they saw. They measured ancient ruined buildings, drew things, and dug around for weeks looking for bits of broken statues and painted pottery that they could put back together. By the time they went back home to Florence, they knew more about Ancient Roman architecture and sculpture than anyone had known for about a thousand years. Brunelleschi became a very famous architect and Donatello became a very famous sculptor.\\n\\n Money and politics \\n \\nThe Renaissance really began in the city of Florence. In those days, Italy was not one single country. It was made of many little states, all governed in different ways. These states were constantly making alliances and fighting with each other.\\n\\nRome was politically powerful, because Rome had the Pope, the person in control of the Roman Catholic Church. Because of his very great importance as a spiritual leader, most people and most cities did not want to argue with any pope. After a pope died, a new pope was elected. Everyone who was rich and powerful hoped a member of their family would be chosen. It was always a good idea to have several young men in the family trained as priests, just in case. It also helped to be good friends with other rich families. One way to do this was to have lots of daughters and get them to marry rich powerful men from different cities. This was the way that politics worked.\\n\\nThere were other powerful cities in Italy too. Venice had a large and powerful navy. Milan controlled trade with Northern Europe and was very rich. Genoa was also very rich, because it controlled trade with France and Spain. Florence, where many people say the Renaissance started, was another important city.\\n\\nFlorence’s strength did not come from a strong army, a strong fortress, or control over trade. It came from banking. The Medicis were an important banking family. They helped to make Florence a powerful city and the centre of Renaissance learning.\\n\\nCapture of Constantinople\\n\\n List of important events of the Renaissance \\n In art \\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|The Birth of Venus\\' by Sandro Botticelli]] \\n\\n 1401: Lorenzo Ghiberti wins a competition to create the Florence Baptistry Doors.

His father was a painter and teacher José Ruiz Blasco and his mother was María Picasso López. Until 1898, he signed his pictures with the names of his father and of his mother. After around 1901, he only used his mother\\'s name. At the age of eight, Picasso created his first oil painting called \"The Picador\". In 1891, Pablo moved with his family to Northern Spain, where his father taught at the Instituto da Guarda. One year later, Pablo studied at this institute. Pablo\\'s father was his teacher at this time. In 1896, he started to attend the art school in Barcelona after passing the entrance examination. One year later in 1897, Picasso started to study at the Academia San Fernando in Madrid. In 1898, he left the academy and went to a rest to Horta de Ebro. In 1900, he published his first illustrations in a newspaper in Barcelona. This exhibition had over 60 portraits.\\n\\nBeginning of the Career \\nPicasso made his first trip to Paris in 1900, where he lived with Max Jacob, a poet and journalist. When Max was working during the day, Pablo slept and when Max slept at night, Pablo worked. Picasso had to burn his paintings to keep himself warm. Lovers in the Street and Moulin de la Galette are examples of his Paris work from this time. Both pictures were painted in 1900.\\n\\nHe went back to Madrid in 1901 where he worked for a newspaper called Arte Joven. He was responsible for illustrations. At this time, he shortened his signature from \"Pablo Ruiz y Picasso\" to \"Picasso\". This is the time his so-called Blue Period started. The two 1903 paintings, The Soup and Crouching Woman, are examples. His Blue Period ended in 1904 when he settled in Paris.\\n\\nIn 1905, Picasso made a trip to Holland. In the same year, Pablo\\'s \"Rosa Period\" started. During this period, Picasso mostly painted circus motives. Girl Balancing on a Ball and The Actor are two early paintings from this time. This period lasted until 1907.\\n\\nPicasso\\'s Cubism period started in 1909 and ended around 1912. This period was inspired by the French painter Paul Cézanne. This period is called Cubism because of the use of cubes and other shapes. During this time, Picasso painted musical instruments, still life objects, and also his friends.\\n\\nPicasso had his first exhibition in the United States in 1911. One year later in 1912, he had his first exhibition in Great Britain. Pablo\\'s father died in May 1913.\\n\\nDuring the First World War \\nFrom 1912 to 1919 was Picasso\\'s so called Synthetic Cubism Period. During this time, he started to use collages in his paintings. His works from this time are called papiers collés. He has spent his time during the First World War in Rome. In 1914, Picasso spent the whole summer in Avignon. In 1915, he started to paint realistic again. At the end of the same year, his wife Eva died. During the World War, he also worked as a designer for Sergey Diaghilev.\\n\\nIn 1917, Picasso met Olga Koklova, a Russian dancer. In the same year, he painted several realistic portraits of her and their friends. One year later, he married her. The last summer of the wartime, Picasso and his wife spent in Barcelona and Biarritz.\\n\\nAfter the First World War \\n\\nIn 1921, Picasso\\'s son Paul was born. Due to this occasion, he painted several paintings with his wife and his son on it. Paul was Picasso\\'s only legitimate son. In 1925, he took part in the first Surrealist exhibition in Paris. Between 1924 and 1926, Picasso preferred to paint abstract still lives. In 1927, hes got known to Marie-Thérèse Walter. She became his model and mistress. In 1928, he started a new period where he began to make sculptural works. In 1931, he left his wife and moved with his mistress to Boisgeloup. There they lived in a country home. There, Picasso had a room for his sculptures only. Since 1932, he used Marie-Thérèse as a model. During a travel in Spain, he started to use the bullfight as a new topic of his paintings. In 1935, Picasso\\'s daughter, Maïa, was born. At this time, he got divorced from his wife because of the birth of Maïa. In 1936, Picasso got a job as director of the Prado-Museum in Madrid. During this time, the Spanish Civil War started. German bombs fell on Guernica in Spain on 26 April 1937. Picasso used this impact to paint one of his most famous paintings, Guernica. This painting was completed in about 2 months. It was first shown in the Spanish Pavilion in Paris in 1937.\\n\\nDuring the Second World War \\nIn 1938, Picasso\\'s mother died. When the Second World War started on 1 September 1939, Picasso returned to Paris. Around 1943, he got known to the painter Françoise Gilot. She bore to him one son and one daughter. In 1941, he wrote his first play \"Le désir attrapé par la queue\" (English: Desire Caught by the Tail). It was first shown in 1944. Also in 1944, Picasso joined the communist Party. Picasso spent almost the full war time in Paris.\\n\\nAfter the Second World War\\n\\nPicasso\\'s Death \\nOn 8th of April 1973, Pablo Picasso died due to heart failure at the age of 91 years in Mougins, France.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\n1881 births\\n1973 deaths\\nCardiovascular disease deaths in France\\nDeaths from heart failure\\nPeople from Malaga\\nSpanish painters\\nSpanish sculptors\\nFormer Roman Catholics',\n",

       "     'content': 'The National Gallery, London is an art gallery in London, England, which has one of the finest collections of European paintings in the world. \\nWhat makes this gallery so important is that, although there are bigger galleries, The National Gallery has many paintings of very high quality and also because it has paintings by famous artists whose works are very rare. These rare paintings include works by Duccio, Masaccio, Uccello, Piero della Francesca, Leonardo, Giorgione, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Vermeer, Chardin, Klimt, Rousseau and Redon.\\n\\nThe National Gallery is on Trafalgar Square, which is one of the busiest tourist places in London. It is a grand building of pale grey limestone, with a central dome and a large Classical style porch (portico) like an Ancient Greek temple. To the left side, the gallery has a large new building called The Sainsbury Wing.\\n\\nHistory \\nIn 1823 a collector called Sir George Beaumont offered to give his famous collection of paintings to the British Government to start a public art gallery. In 1824 another famous collection of paintings was on sale. The owner, John Julius Angerstein, had died. It looked as if his paintings would be sold outside England. Then there was another offer of paintings from a third collector, The Reverend Holwell Carr. The Parliament had to make a quick decision.\\n\\nThe Parliament voted that a national collection should be started and a gallery should be built. They gave 60,000 Pounds Sterling to buy the Angerstein paintings. They got 38 pictures and were able to display them publicly in the Angerstein House. \\n\\nThe collection grew quickly with the Beaumont and Holwell Carr paintings, and others, being bought or given. A new gallery was needed. In 1831 the plans of the architect William Wilkins were accepted. The site which looks over Trafalgar Square was chosen, old buildings were demolished and the magnificent new gallery was opened on April 9, 1838.\\n\\nWhen the National Gallery opened, there was a strong opinion that paintings of the High Renaissance period of the late 1400s to Baroque paintings of the 1600s were the finest type of art. The word primitive was used to describe Italian paintings from the 1300s and early 1400s. Luckily, the director of the Gallery, Sir Charles Eastlake, thought it was important to collect some of these primitive paintings, as well as the more popular High Renaissance paintings. That is how the National Gallery came to own so many very rare works from the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance periods.\\n\\nIn the 1870s the Gallery was lucky to get two collections of paintings by famous Dutch artists. The building had to be made larger to house them. The Gallery was also given paintings by famous British artists; soon there were so many that most of them were moved out to a new gallery called the Tate.\\n\\nBy the 20th century, it was getting more difficult to buy very important paintings; there were other galleries in the United States and Germany who were trying to buy the same paintings. So the National Gallery began to buy works by more modern painters and soon had a collection of 19th and early 20th century paintings. This is not a large part of the National Gallery\\'s collection, but it does show small works by many very important artists, particularly the Impressionists.\\n\\nImportant paintings\\n\\nEarly Italian \\n Duccio, Madonna and Child, c.1300, Sienna\\n Masaccio, Madonna and Child, c.1426, Florence\\n Fra Angelico, Christ in Glory, c.1435, Florence\\n\\n \\n Uccello, St George and the Dragon, c.1450, Florence\\nThe story of this painting is Christian legend about dragon that has stolen a princess. The princess charmed the dragon and tied it with her belt, but she could not escape. The noble George came to her rescue and killed the Dragon. There are many paintings of Saint George in the National Gallery because he is the patron saint of England. Uccello has tried to show the perspective of the landscape by arranging light and dark areas on the ground. Diagonal lines are important in this picture. The line made by the dragon\\'s wing and leg go the same direction as George\\'s spear while the body and tail go in the opposite direction.\\n Piero della Francesca, The Baptism of Christ, c.1450, Umbria\\n Mantegna, The Agony in the Garden, 1460, Mantua\\n Pollaiuolo, The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, 1475, Florence\\n\\n Sandro Botticelli, Mars and Venus, 1480s, Florence\\nThe story of this painting comes from Roman Mythology. Mars the God of War, has been making love to Venus, the Goddess of Love. He is so tired that he does not know that little fauns are playing with his weapons. But one is about to blow a big shell loudly in his ear. The message of this painting is that Love can win over War. The design is based on a big W. which makes the painting symmetrical. Botticelli did this for the bedroom of Giuliano de\\'Medici, a wealthy nobleman from Florence. He painted Mars to look like Giuliano and Venus to look like his girlfriend but Giuliano did not have much time to enjoy his paintings as he was murdered only a short time later.\\n Perugino, Madonna and Child with the angels Michael and Raphael, 1496, Perugia\\n Giovanni Bellini, Portrait of Leonardo Loredano, Doge of Venice, 1501, Venice\\n\\nEarly Northern European painting \\n\\n Unknown painter, The Wilton Diptych, c.1395, England or France\\nThe Wilton Diptych is one of the most precious paintings in the National Gallery, because most small art works from Middle Ages in England were destroyed. This painting shows King Richard II of England being presented to the Virgin Mary by his three patron saints. It is painted in tempera; the colours are mixed with egg. The word \"diptych\" means it is in two parts and can be closed like a book. The background is covered with thinly beaten gold leaf. The blue is made from ground-up semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli.

He is called the \"donor\". Everything in the picture has been painted in great detail, the clothes, the tiles, the jewelry, the buildings and the flowers. Many of the things in the picture are symbols. The little dog is the symbol of faithfulness. The lilies are the symbol of the purity of the Virgin Mary. The painting does not show part of a story or a moment in time.

Princess Ariadne has been shipwrecked on Naxos, the island of Bacchus. Bacchus sees Ariadne and falls in love at first sight. Titian shows him leaping from his chariot which is pulled by cheetahs, while Ariadne turns to run away. But Ariadne has looked into Bacchus\\'s eyes, and she has fallen in love also. In the sky is the crown of stars which Bacchus gave her at their wedding. Titian has painted a spiral movement in many of the figures. It can be seen in Ariadne\\'s red scarf. Although this painting is about Mythology, the figures are very realistic.\\n Parmigiano, Madonna and Child with St John, 1527, Parma\\n\\n Lorenzo Lotto, Lady as Lucretia, 1530, Venice\\n This portrait shows a woman in a richly coloured velvet dress, holding a drawing of Lucretia, a noble woman of Ancient Rome who committed suicide by stabbing herself after she had been raped. The painting may have been done for a family who wanted their daughter to marry well. The symbolism of the painting shows firstly that the young woman is rich and secondly, she is sexually pure. These two things were important in making a good marriage. Lotto has used contrast of colour in the orange and green dress to make a rich effect. He has also made an unusual use in the contrast of tone. Very light areas such as her face, bosom and hand control the centre of the painting. Three more very light areas are placed to the right side, the drawing, hand and note. This arrangement is asymmetrical\\n Bronzino, Allegory, c.1550, Florence. See below.\\n Tintoretto, St George and the Dragon, 1560s, Venice\\n\\nItaly, France and Spain in the 1600s \\n \\n Caravaggio, The Supper at Emmaus, c.1600, Rome\\nThis painting is based on a story from the Bible. Two of Jesus\\' followers were walking on the road to Emmaus, talking sadly about the death of Jesus. A man came and walked with them, but at first they did not know him. That night, having dinner at an inn, they suddenly knew it was Jesus who had risen from the dead and was now alive. Caravaggio has shown this moment in time as if it was a photograph. The things that make this picture seem so real are the light, the movement and the details. Caravaggio has painted the light coming from one side as if there was a large lamp. The head of the innkeeper makes a shadow behind Jesus that is like a halo. The picture has caught a single second when Jesus has raised his hand, one man starts to stand up and the other is throwing his arms out. Only the innkeeper is still. The view of Jesus\\' hand, the man\\'s arms and the other man\\'s elbow are foreshortened. The details show ordinary people with ordinary clothes that are old and torn. There is also a still life of the basket at the edge of the table. Caravaggio\\'s lighting and realism were copied by many other painters, including Rembrandt and Velazquez.\\n El Greco, Christ driving the Traders from the Temple, c.1600, Toledo\\n Annibale Carracci, Quo vadis?, 1602, Rome\\n\\n Claude Le Lorrain, Departure of the Queen of Sheba, 1648, France and Rome\\n This imaginary landscape is based on a story from the Bible. In this scene, the Queen of Sheba is setting out on her journey from Africa to Palestine to meet King Solomon. But what the artist really wanted to show was the misty morning light of the sunrise over the sea. He has also painted three different types of buildings. To the left is an ancient ruin like the ones the artist saw in Rome. In the background is a castle and tower from the Middle Ages.  To the left the Queen is coming out of a grand palace in the new style of the Renaissance. Nothing in this painting has anything to do with Africa or Palestine. It is about Rome. By showing the Queen of Sheba, Poussin is saying that the city of Rome, with all its history for 2000 years, is like the most beautiful and intelligent Queen that ever lived. This sort of painting is called an \"allegory\".\\n\\n Nicholas Poussin, Bacchanale, 1603, France and Rome\\n This painting is a scene from Roman Mythology. The women are nymphs, the spirits of the forest. Some of the men are satyrs and have goats\\' horns and hoofs. They live on Naxos, the island of Bacchus, and spend a lot of time getting drunk, dancing and making love. In this wild party, even the babies are drinking wine. One nymph is about to smash a wine jug on the head of a satyr, who is trying to kiss her friend. Poussin has used big areas of bright colour. At first, the painting looks like a jumble of bodies, but everything is very carefully arranged to give a dancing effect to the whole picture. A big triangular shape contains all the figures. Outside the triangle on the right is a statue of Pan. On the left side is a beautiful landscape.\\n\\n Diego Velazquez, The Rokeby Venus, 1649, Madrid.\\nThis picture is taken from Roman Mythology. It shows Venus, Goddess of Love and Beauty, looking into a mirror held by her son Cupid. Velazquez spent most of his time painting portraits for the Royal Family of Spain and their relatives. He is one of the most famous portrait painters of all time. But this painting was probably done for himself, and when he did it, he put himself in danger of serious punishment. In Spain, although the King ruled, the Church was in control. They watched everything that everybody did, and had a very large number of people put to death. It was against the law in Spain to paint nude pictures like this one. Velazquez has been very careful to only show her back. The image of the face is not very clear. Old mirrors were not as clear as modern ones. Perhaps Velazquez wanted to disguise the face of the woman for her protection. The arrangement and colouring in this painting is very simple. The graceful lines of the body are repeated in the grey and white bed covers. The red curtain is at the same angle as her head, and is a warm colour, like her pink flesh.\\n Murillo, The Two Trinities, 1681, Seville\\n\\nHolland and Flanders in the 1600s \\n Gerrit von Honthorst, Christ before the High priest, 1617, Utrecht\\n\\n \\n Rembrandt, Belshazzar\\'s Feast, 1630s, Leyden\\nRembrandt is best known as a painter of portraits, in particular for the many self portraits that record his life from when he was a teenager to his old age. He also painted many scenes from the Bible like this one. Prince Belshazzar\\'s father had taken the Jewish people to Babylon as slaves. Belshazzar was giving a party and he sent servants to bring the gold cups that had been stolen from the Temple in Jerusalem. Suddenly a strange hand appeared and wrote a message on the wall. No-one knew what it meant so Balshazzar asked Daniel, who was a Jewish prophet. Daniel said \"You have been weighed and measured by God. You do not meet God\\'s rules. Your days are numbered!\" This painting shows how much the Dutch painters learnt from Caravaggio. This painting can be compared to the Supper at Emmaus. It is another scene full of drama. Rembrandt has placed two of the figures at unusual angles. Belshazzar\\'s body is facing the viewer, but his head is screwed around to see what is happening behind him. As he leaps up from his chair, he knocks the golden cup held by one of his wives. She is also at an odd angle because the viewer lookes down on her head and shoulders. Rembrandt has made a contrast between the rich texture of his robes and his flabby face and fat belly.\\n Anthony van Dyck, Charles I of England on Horseback, 1631, London. See below.\\n\\n Peter Paul Rubens, The Judgement of Paris, 1632, Antwerp\\nRubens was such a popular painter that he became rich and famous. He painted portraits and many scenes from the Bible and Mythology. The story of this painting is from Greek and Roman Mythology. Paris was a prince who was brought up by a shepherd. He was given a golden apple and asked to judge a beauty contest between three Goddesses: Juno, the Goddess of the Family; Minerva, the Goddess of War and Venus, the Goddess of Love. Each one offered a reward: wealth, success in battle and the most beautiful woman in the world as his wife. Paris chose the last and gave the apple to Venus. This made two very powerful people angry. And, what he did not realise was that the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Troy, was already married.  Rubens has painted a picture to decorate the wall of the home of a rich patron. The painting has lots of details that help to tell the story. These include little Cupid, a sheepdog, Juno\\'s peacock, Minerva\\'s scary shield and sheep grazing in the beautiful landscape. But the most important things in the painting are the three beautiful nudes. This was what made Ruben\\'s pictures so popular.\\n\\n Franz Hals, Family group, 1640s, Antwerp\\n Pieter der Hoogh, Courtyard in Delft, 1658, Delft. See below.\\n Johannes Vermeer, Young Woman at the Virginals, c.1670, Delft. See below.\\n\\n \\n Meyndert Hobbema, The Avenue, 1689, Middelharnis\\n Landscape painting became very popular in Holland in the 1600s. In this picture perspective is very important. In a very flat country, it can be hard to judge how far away things are. Hobbema has used this straight road with two rows of tall trees to give a feeling of how far away the town is. At first glance this painting seems quite symmetrical. But Hobbema has added lots of differences to make the painting more interesting, balancing a farmhouse on one side with a church on the other and making the two rows of trees quite different.\\n\\nThe 1700s \\n Watteau, The Lovers, c.1720, France\\n Giambattista Pittoni ,The Sacrifice of Polyxena, 1740, Venice\\n Canaletto, The Basin of St Mark\\'s on Ascension Day, c.1740, Venice\\n Chardin, The little Teacher, c.1740, Paris.

Most landscape paintings were also records of a family and the land that they owned. They were a sign of the family\\'s wealth and status. In this painting the landowners show off their private park with its variety of trees. They also show off their splendid pair of horses and their elegant carriage called a \"phaeton\". Together, this coach and horses are the 18th century equivalent of a very expensive car. Stubbs was most famous for painting horses. He was a master at composing beautiful pictures. Here, he has created a balance between the lady\\'s large fashionable hat set against the dark tree and the black horses against the pale sky.\\n Tiepolo, Allegory of Love and Time, 1754, Italy\\n Joshua Reynolds, Sir Banastre Tarleton, 1782, London\\n Thomas Gainsborough, The Morning Walk, 1786, London\\n Goya, The Duke of Wellington, 1812, Spain and France\\n\\n1800 onwards \\n \\n Turner, The Temeraire, 1838, London\\nThis is a sad painting. Its full name is The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up as scrap. This is the last journey for one of the great warships that had fought for England against the French Fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar. Her tall elegant shape makes a contrast to the dirty black tugboat with smoking funnel that is towing her away. Turner, who was expert at painting the sea, the sky and the weather, has placed the moon in the sky near the sailing ship. The moon is in its last phase. On the other side of the picture, the sun rises with a red glow like fire on the water. The waning moon is the symbol of the passing of the age of great sailing ships. The blazing sun on the water is the symbol of the new age of the steam engine.\\n Constable, The Haywain, 1821, Suffolk\\n Ingres, Madame Moitessier, 1856, Paris\\n Courbet, Women on the Bank of the Seine, 1857, France\\n\\n Henri Fantin-Latour, Apples on a Dish, 1861, France\\nThis picture is a still life. In the Renaissance, carvings of still lifes were often part of the wooden decoration inside important rooms in a palace. In the 1600s and 1700s paintings of still lifes also became common and were most often seen in the dining room, where fruit, flowers and animals that had been killed for meat were fashionable decoration. In the 1800s many artists like Fantin-Latour painted small still lifes like this one to practice their skills at arranging a picture, at studying light and at studying texture. Many artists also painted still lifes because they were too poor to pay for an artist\\'s model, or the weather was too bad to paint landscapes. Fantin-Latour did a large number of small pictures like this. He has arranged four apples of different colours and shapes and has made a study of how the light looks on their curved surfaces.\\n Manet, The Waitress, 1879, Paris\\n Claude Monet, The Houses of Parliament, London, French painter. See below.\\n Renoir, The Umbrellas, c.1880, France\\n\\n \\n Seurat, The Bathers at Asnieres, 1884, France\\nSeurat was a friend of the French Impressionist painters. He had a theory that all colour was made up of lots of colours which were sorted out when light passed into the eye. He experimented with colour by painting in tiny dots. His style of painting is called Pointillism. This large painting took a long time to do. Even though it is an outdoor scene with lots of figures, it is very still, as if time has stopped. When the painting is looked at closely, it can be seen that even the parts that seem white or black are made of hundreds of tiny dots of colour.\\n Edgar Degas, Combing Hair, c.1885, Paris\\n Cezanne, Mountains in Provence, 1890, Provence\\n\\n Vincent van Gogh, Landscape with Cypress Pine, c.1890, France\\nVincent van Gogh had a difficult and troubled life. He was born in Holland but went to paint in France. He had very few friends and had difficulty selling his paintings. Luckily he had the support of his brother Theo and a doctor for whom he painted pictures. This landscape is a good example of his style. In the painting, everything seems to have a life of its own. The clouds are like great beasts that roll across the sky, the waving grain reaches out like hands, the mountains are rumbling and the cypress pine looks quite dangerous. Vincent used each brush stroke to help create this flame-like movement. Another important thing in this painting is contrast. The colours change from warm reddish-orange to ice-blue. The big dark tree to the right is in tonal contrast with the white clouds. The vertical direction of the tree is in contrast to the horizontal direction of the landscape. In 1890, Vincent took his own life after painting hundreds of pictures in only five years.\\n Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Woman in the Garden, 1891, France\\n Douanier Rousseau, Tiger frightened by a Storm, 1891, Paris\\n Gustav Klimt, Portrait of Hermine Gallia, 1904, Vienna\\n\\nGallery\\n\\nRelated pages\\n Uffizi\\n Louvre\\n Hermitage\\n\\nReferences \\n Michael Wilson, The National Gallery, London, 1977, Charles Letts and Co. \\n\\nMuseums in London\\nArt museums in the United Kingdom\\nNational museums',\n",

       "     'content': 'Scandinavia is a group of countries in northern Europe. Scandinavia is Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.  Some people also think Finland is part of Scandinavia.  Others also say Iceland and the Faroe Islands should count. Most of the time, \"Scandinavia\" is used to mean places where people speak Scandinavian languages (also called North Germanic languages or Nordic). The Scandinavian languages (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic and Finnish) are very similar to each other, and many Scandinavians understand some of the other languages because they are reasonably similar, expect Finnish because it doesn’t belong to the North Germanic language group. Scandinavia is also the smallest region in Europe.\\n\\nWhat people mean when they say \"Scandinavia\" depends on what they think is important at the time.  Mostly, when people want to talk about about maps, natural land formations and how the economy works, they say Finland is part of Scandinavia but Iceland isn\\'t.  When people want to talk about history and what languages people speak, they say Iceland is part of Scandinavia but Finland isn\\'t.\\n\\nThe Scandinavian Peninsula is a large peninsula reaching west from northern Europe over the north side of the Baltic Sea.  Norway, Sweden and some of Finland are on this peninsula. However, Denmark is considered part of Scandinavia in the ethnic sense more often than Finland is.  This is because Danish is a Scandinavian language but Finnish is not.\\n\\nSome people like to say \"Nordic countries\" instead of \"Scandinavia\" because they think it is more correct about geography, but the Nordic countries include Norway, Sweden, Denmark (including the Faroe Islands), Finland, and Iceland.  These five countries use the Nordic Council to work together on political and cultural activities. Denmark, Sweden, and Finland are also members of the European Union, but only Finland is part of the eurozone, meaning that it uses the Euro as its money. The other Nordic countries still use their own money, called krone or krona (from the word \"crowns\").  Norway and Iceland, which are not members of the EU, are members of NATO and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Only Denmark is a member of both the EU and NATO.\\n\\nGeography\\n\\nMost of the Scandinavian Peninsula has only a few people in it. It has large forests of pine, birch, and spruce trees. The western and northern parts are mountainous; the Scandinavian mountains are some of the oldest in the world. The tallest mountain is Galdhøpiggen in Norway.  Denmark (43,098\\xa0km2) is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries. It is more densely populated, and most of the land is farmland.  Sweden (449,964\\xa0km2) is the largest of the Scandinavian countries.  It has the most lakes, and the landscape ranges from plains in the south to mountains in the west (along the border with Norway) to tundra in the north.  The far north of Scandinavia and Finland is called Lapland, where the Sami people live.  Some of them still herd reindeer, but most Sami live in modern houses and have modern jobs, like other Scandinavians.\\n\\nVikings \\n\\nThe most famous group of Scandinavians is the Vikings of the Middle Ages.  The Vikings attacked and raided but they were also traders, traveling to the Ukraine and starting trade routes to the Middle East.\\n\\nVikings from Norway were explorers, crossing the North Atlantic in their longships. They came to Iceland and Greenland and built towns and farms there.  The Norwegian explorers also came to the east coast of Canada, where they set up at least one settlement, but it did not last into modern times.\\n\\nThe Vikings from Denmark came to England, where they affected the history and politics and even the English language.  Danish raiders attacked England many times with great violence.  Sometimes the Danes would ask that the English pay them to go away.  These payments were called \"Danegeld\" (Danish gold).  The priests and bishops of churches on the east coast of England wrote a famous prayer: \"deliver us, O Lord, from the wrath of the Norsemen!\" \"Norsemen\" is another way to say \"men from the north,\" or the Danes.\\n\\nScandinavians in fiction and theater\\n\\nMuch later, in the 19th century (1800s), Richard Wagner and other artists in the Romantic period made operas and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture.  They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans.  They were the first to have the idea of Vikings wearing helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns.  Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not.  Wagner and his partners deliberately dressed the actors in the opera Ring des Nibelungen so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings.\\n\\nHistory\\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, when the Christian religion spread through Scandiavia, modern countries started to form there. They came together into three kingdoms:\\n Denmark\\n Sweden\\n Norway \\nThese three Scandinavian kingdoms made the Kalmar Union in 1387 under Queen Margaret I of Denmark. However, in 1523, Sweden left the union. Because of this, civil war broke out in Denmark and Norway. Then, the Protestant Reformation happened, and Catholic and Protestant Christians fought each other. After things settled, the Norwegian Privy Council was abolished: it assembled for the last time in 1537. Denmark and Norway formed another union in 1536, and it lasted until 1814.  It turned into the three modern countries Denmark, Norway and Iceland.\\n\\nThe borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway came to the shape they have today in the middle of the seventeenth century: In the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, Denmark–Norway gave some territory to Sweden: the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland, Härjedalen and Idre & Särna and the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Ösel (in Estonia).   The 1658 Treaty of Roskilde forced Denmark–Norway to give the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bornholm, and the Norwegian provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag to Sweden.  In 1660, the Treaty of Copenhagen forced Sweden to give Bornholm and Trøndelag back to Denmark–Norway.\\n\\nFinland used to be part of Sweden in medieval times.

       "     'content': 'The European Union (abbreviation: EU) is a confederation of 27 member countries in Europe established by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992-1993.  The EU grew out of the European Economic Community (EEC) which was established by the Treaties of Rome in 1957. It has created a common economic area with Europe-wide laws allowing the citizens of EU countries to move and trade in other EU countries almost the same as they do in their own. Nineteen of these countries also share the same type of money: the euro.\\n\\nThe name of Europe comes from the Latin Europa, which in turn derives from the Greek Εὐρώπη, from εὐρύς eurys \"wide\" and ὤψ ops \"face\".\\n\\nThe Treaty of Lisbon is the most recent treaty that says how the Union is run. Every member state signed to say that they each agreed with what it says. Most importantly, it says which jobs (’powers’) the Union should do for the members and which jobs they should do themselves. The members decide how the Union should act by voting for or against proposals.\\n\\nThe objective of the EU is to bring its member states closer together with respect of human rights and democracy. It does this with a common style of passport, common rules about fair trading with each other, common agreements about law enforcement, and other agreements. Most members share a common currency (the euro) and most allow people to travel from one country to another without having to show a passport.\\n\\nHistory \\n\\nAfter World War II, the countries in Europe wanted to live peacefully together and help one another\\'s economies. Instead of fighting each other for coal and steel, the first member countries (West) Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg created one European Coal and Steel Community in 1952.\\n\\nIn 1957 in the Italian city of Rome, the member countries signed another treaty and made the European Economic Community. Now it was a community for coal, steel and for trade. Later it changed the name to  the European Community.\\n\\nIn 1993, with the Treaty of Maastricht it changed its name to the European Union. Now the member countries work together not only in politics and economy (coal, steel and trade), but also in money, justice (laws), and foreign affairs. With the Schengen Agreement, 22 member countries of the EU opened their borders to each other, so people can now travel from one country to the other without a passport or identity card. Many of the countries of the EU also share a currency, which is called the euro. 10 new countries became members of the EU in 2004, 2 more became members in 2007, and 1 more in 2013. In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. Today there are 27 member countries altogether.\\n\\nFree movement \\nA person who is a citizen of the European Union can live and work in any of the 27 member states without needing a work permit or visa. For example, a French person can move to Greece to work there, or just to live there, and he or she does not need permission from an authority in Greece.\\n\\nIn the same way, products made in one member country can be sold in any other member country without any special permissions or extra taxes. For this reason, the members agree rules on product safety - they want to know that a product made in another country will be as safe as it would be if it had been made in their own.\\n\\nMain institutions \\nInstitutions of the European Union\\n\\nCouncil of the European Union \\n\\nThe Council of the European Union is the main decision-making group. The cabinet ministers of the member countries meet (Ministers for Foreign affairs, for Agriculture, for Justice, etc...) and discuss issues that are important to them.\\n\\nBefore the Treaty of Lisbon (written in 2007, implemented in 2008) each member state takes a turn at being President of the Council for six months. For example, from January 2007 until July 2007, Germany held the presidency. The six months before that, Finland held the presidency. Now the President of the European Union chairs the council summits. The President of the Council is the organiser and manager and is voted into office for a duration of two and a half years. He or she does not have the power to make decisions about the European Union like the President of the United States does for that country.\\n\\nMember countries with a large population (Germany, France, United Kingdom, etc.) have more votes than countries with small populations (Luxembourg, Malta, etc.) but a decision cannot be made if enough countries vote against the decision.\\n\\nTwice a year, the heads of government (Prime Ministers) and/or the heads of state (Presidents) meet to talk about the main issues and make decisions on different issues. This meeting is different and not as formal. It is known as a European Council.\\n\\nNote: This is not the same thing as the Council of Europe, which is not part of the European Union.\\n\\nEuropean Commission \\n\\nThe European Commission runs the day-to-day running of the EU and writes laws, like a government. Laws written by the Commission are discussed and changed by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.\\n\\nThe Commission has one President and 27 Commissioners, selected by the European Council. The Commission President is appointed by the European Council with the approval of the European Parliament.\\n\\nThe Commission operates like a cabinet government. There is one Commissioner per member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.\\n\\nEuropean Parliament \\n\\nThe Parliament has a total of 705 members (called Members of the European Parliament, or MEP). They are elected in their countries every five years by the citizens of the European Union member countries. The Parliament can approve, reject or change proposed laws. It can also sack the European Commission. In that case, the entire commission would have to give up their jobs.\\n\\nPolitics \\nThere are many discussions in the EU about how it should develop and change in the future.\\n\\nThe main reasons why European countries came together are political and economic:\\n The need to prevent another European war after World War I and World War II.\\n The need to respect human rights, rule of law and democracy more affirmed by Council of Europe.\\n The need to have a common economic area.\\n\\nMember States \\n\\nIn 1951, six countries made the European Coal and Steel Community, a basic version of what the EU is now. These six then went further and in 1957 they made the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community. The UK and others decided not to join, and then when the UK changed its mind it was stopped from joining by French President Charles de Gaulle. When he was no longer President, the UK and others started to join. Today there are 27 members but the idea that more should join is not seen as a good one by everyone.\\n\\nSerbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Turkey and Iceland are \"candidate countries\"; they are being considered for membership. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are expected to follow.\\n\\nHowever, since there have been many political problems happening in Turkey recently, especially with President Edrogan\\'s arresting of tens of thousands of political rivals since the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016, it is unlikely that it would be allowed to part of the EU anytime soon because EU members believe that the current Turkish government is not respecting human rights, rule of law, or democracy.\\n\\nMotto\\nUnited in diversity (or together with many types of people in Simple English), is the motto of the European Union.\\n\\nThe motto in other languages:\\n\\nBrexit \\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum on whether it should stay in the EU or leave it. The majority [52% to 48%] favored leaving. Britain leaving the EU is commonly known as Brexit.\\n\\nThe government of the UK invoked \"Article 50\" of the Treaty of European Union (the Treaty of Lisbon) on 29 March 2017. This began negotiations with fellow members of the EU on the terms of exit. The timetable for these negotiations is two years, which meant that the UK would remain a member of the EU until at least March 2019. However this deadline was later extended to October 31st 2019 at the request of the British Government. The United Kingdom left the European Union on the 31 of January 2020 at 23:00 (Greenwich Mean Time). Following the UK left from the European Union on January 31, the transition period  expired on December 31, 2020 and ended on January 1, 2021.\\n\\nRelated pages\\n Citizenship of the European Union\\n Multilingualism\\n Brexit\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n European Union online portal\\n Lithuania\\'s EU Council Presidency \\n \\'Your Europe\\' information website\\n Europe of cultures 50 years of artistic creation and cultural life from the 27 countries of the European Union\\n\\n \\n1952 establishments in Europe\\nG7 nations\\nG8 nations',\n",

The event took place on August 19, 1989.\\n\\nThe event \\nThe event was planned to be a peaceful demonstration. Both countries agreed to open a gate in the border fence, between Sankt Margarethen im Burgenland (near Eisenstadt), and Sopronkőhida (Steinambrückl) on the Hungarian side of the border.\\n\\nThe leaders of the time were Otto von Habsburg and the Hungarian minister, Imre Pozsgay. The person who did the actual cutting of the border fence was the general secretary of the International Paneuropean Union, Walburga Habsburg Douglas. The gate was to be symbolically opened for three hours.\\n\\nMore than 600 citizens of the German Democratic Republic took the chance to cross into the west once the Iron Curtain was opened. They had been told about the event by its organizers. At that time, the Hungarian border police still had orders to shoot anyone trying to cross the border illegally. However, they acted carefully and did not shoot at the fleeing people, this time.\\n\\nThe number of people who actually crossed the border to enter the west was only a few hundred on that first day. On the following days, the border was watched more closely, due to orders by the Hungarian government. Therefore, a smaller number of people managed to flee then. Hungary opened its borders to citizens of East Germany on 11 September 1989.\\n\\nRemembering the event \\nToday, the Paneuropean Picnic is seen as one of the important events that led to the end of the German Democratic Republic and the Cold War, the fall of the Iron Curtain, and the unification of the two German states. \\nThe event is celebrated every year on 19 August on the spot where the border was opened.\\n\\nToday, artwork made by Hungarian artists is at the place where the fence was cut. It shows a partly opened door.\\n\\nIn 1996, a 10 meter statue was built in Fertőrákos near Sopron. It was made by Gabriela von Habsburg. It shows a piece of barbed wire.

The Arctic Ocean is to its north, and the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean to its south. It is the largest of the continents. Its name comes from adding the \"Eur\" from \"Europe\" to \"Asia\". It and Africa form a part of the world called \"Afro-Eurasia\". \\n\\nSome geographers say Eurasia is one continent, because Europe and Asia are mostly on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them. The Ancient Greeks divided the world they knew into Europe, Asia and Africa. To them, the Aegean Sea was the division between the Balkan Peninsula in Europe and Asia Minor in Asia. North of the Sea of Marmara, the Greeks thought the lands on the western side of the Black Sea was Europe and the eastern side was Asia. The ancient Greeks did not know very much about the lands north of the Black Sea. Since Classical Antiquity, people have talked about Asia and Europe separately, so it is now a tradition to see them as two continents.\\n\\nSome other continents, which are not completely divided by sea, are joined together by a thin strip of land (called an isthmus). An example is North America and South America, which are connected by the Isthmus of Panama. Europe and Asia are not divided by a sea, nor by any isthmus.\\n\\nOutside of geological definitions, Eurasia also includes the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula.\\n\\nSometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia. Here, the dividing line is the Ural Mountains. West Eurasia includes Europe and the Middle East. Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia, because the Sahara Desert divides North Africa from Sub-Saharan Africa, and it is as difficult to cross as a sea. Also, North Africa is culturally linked to Europe by the Mediterranean Sea.\\n\\nList of countries \\n\\n \\n (EU)\\n \\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n (EU)\\n (EU) Geologically in Europe and Asia\\n (EU)\\n (EU) Geologically in Europe and North America\\n\\n (EU)\\n (EU)\\n (EU)\\n Geologically in Europe and Asia\\n (EU)\\n (EU)\\n (EU)\\n Geologically in Europe and North America\\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n Geologically in Europe and Asia\\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n (EU)\\n (EU)\\n (EU)\\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n \\n\\n (EU)\\n (EU)\\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n \\n\\n (EU)\\n (EU)\\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n (EU)\\n\\n Geologically in Europe and Asia\\n\\nThe OECD’s Eurasia activities involve 13 countries extending from the borders of the European Union to the Far East:\\n\\n Afghanistan\\n Armenia\\n Azerbaijan\\n Belarus\\n Georgia\\n Kazakhstan\\n Kyrgyzstan\\n Mongolia\\n Republic of Moldova\\n Tajikistan\\n Turkmenistan\\n Ukraine\\n Uzbekistan\\n Turkey\\n\\nLaurasia',\n",

They started around the year 476 , when the Western Roman Empire ended, and continued until around the time Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World in 1492. This period of time is called the 'Middle Ages' because it took place between the fall of Imperial Rome and the beginning of early modern Europe.  It is often separated into the Early Middle Ages, the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages.\\n\\nSometimes people use other names, like “the Medieval Age,” to describe the Middle Ages.  Another name for the Middle Ages is “the Age of Faith,” because Christianity and Islam were becoming much more popular.  The early Middle Ages has also been called “the Dark Ages” because past scholars wrongly believed that there was very little culture, good literature, or art, or progress during this period.\\n\\nVery few people in the Middle Ages could read, so there are not many records from this period.  Because of this, historians do not know as much about the Middle Ages as about earlier times.\\n\\nDuring the Middle Ages, many people’s lives were short, difficult, and poor. The fall of the Roman Empire, and the invasions of barbarian tribes, devastated Europe.  The Romans had made a lot of progress in science, technology, engineering, medicine, and literature.  During the Middle Ages, a lot of this new knowledge was lost.  There were mass migrations, wars, and plagues.  For around 300 years, there was continuous violence.  After that, the development of feudalism decreased some of the violence.\\n\\nIn 800 ce, Charlemagne became Emperor of the Romans. He promoted order, education, and civilization. Slowly, Europe began to regain what it had lost. Still, the Late Middle Ages were a difficult time.  Wars and the Bubonic Plague killed millions of people in Europe and Asia.\\n\\nEurope changed during the Middle Ages. Independent, unified nation states formed across the old Western Roman Empire. These new nations included England, Scotland, Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Lithuania, Denmark, Norway, and France (which evolved from the realm of the Franks).\\n\\nByzantium: The eastern side of Rome \\n\\nIn 330 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine created the Byzantine Empire (also called the Eastern Roman Empire).  He made the capital city Constantinople.  The Byzantine Empire controlled Asia Minor and Northern Africa, and sometimes southern Spain and southern Italy.  However, its lands were slowly eaten away by enemies like the Turks and the Franks.\\n\\nThe Byzantine Empire survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire and lasted until 1453.  Constantinople was a walled city on a peninsula.  This made it difficult for invaders to take over.    Finally, in 1453, the Ottoman Empire captured Constantinople.  They gave the city its present-day name: Istanbul.  This was the end of the Byzantine Empire.\\n\\nThe fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks is sometimes called the end of the Middle Ages.\\n\\nIslam and its golden age \\nThe Islamic prophet Muhammad founded Islam in the early 7th century.  Soon after his death in 632 CE, Islam split into two branches.  These were the Sunni Muslims and the Shi'a.  Most Muslims (about 85%) are Sunni.  Shi'a Muslims live mostly in modern-day Iran and Iraq. The Sunni-Shi'a split has been compared to the Protestant Reformation within the Christian Church much later, in 1517.\\n\\nAfter the Prophet Muhammad’s death, Arab Muslims began to take over many Christian territories and convert them to Islam.  Over time, they took control of modern-day Iraq, Syria, Egypt, North Africa and Spain.  (France and other European countries stayed under Christian rule.) Eventually, the Muslim Ottoman Empire conquered parts of eastern Europe too.  Many Muslim states held of vast areas of land, making them superpowers of the Middle Ages.  Islam spread along the major trade routes of the old world.  Many traders and travelers became Muslim.\\n\\nThe Middle Ages were a golden age of knowledge in Muslim territories.  While Europe was struggling greatly, the Islamic world was making great progress in the arts, agriculture, economics, industry, law, literature, navigation, philosophy, sciences, and technology.  Many Muslim caliphs and Sultans gathered the ancient texts of great classical empires.  (For example, the Caliphs of Andalusian Cordoba gathered ancient Roman texts, and the Anatolian Seljuk Sultans gathered ancient Greek texts.). During this Islamic Golden Age, a Persian Muslim helped to develop algebra.\\n\\nThe golden age of Islam ended with the Mongol invasions in the mid-13th century.\\n\\nAsian Trade and the Bubonic Plague \\nDuring the Middle Ages, trade between countries became much more common. Most trade ran along the Silk Road, a trade route that connected Europe to the Middle East and East Asia. Arab traders brought things back and forth between Europe and East Asia along the Silk Road.\\n\\nItems that were light, easy to carry, and valuable traveled the furthest distances. During the high Middle Ages, wealth began to return and consumers began to demand luxuries again. Traders brought silk, porcelain, spices, incense, gold and gems thousands of miles across deserts, mountains and plains to reach Europe.  They also brought glass from Europe to Asia.\\n\\nNot all items traveled along the entire Silk Road.  Traders carrying heavier, less valuable items would travel shorter distances. Food, for example, would mostly travel only within a few villages.\\n\\nTrade was greatly interrupted several times during the Crusades (1095-1291) due to Mongolian invasions, wars between Muslims and Christians, and (later) the Black Plague. Histories think the Mongols brought the plague with them from Asia. This disease devastated the world population from 1347-1351. It killed almost a third of the world's population (although the Americas were not affected).\\n\\nBuddhism in the Middle Ages \\nBuddhism is a non-theistic religion (meaning its followers do not believe in a god).  It is based on philosophy.  It began in India.  However, Muslim invaders drove Buddhism out of India.  This forced Buddhism to flee east.  There are very few Buddhists in India today, but Buddhism eventually took up strong roots in China.\\n\\nThe Mongolian Empire and Chinese Exploration \\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Mongols created the world's largest contiguous empire.  Under the leadership of Genghis Khan, the Mongols took over territories in much of Asia, the Middle East, and far eastern Europe.  Because the Mongol Empire was so large and powerful, there was little war within the empire.  This period is now called the Pax Mongolica (pax is Latin for “peace”).  Like the earlier Roman Pax Romana, the Pax Mongolica was a time of relative peace and stability.  This made it possible for trade, technologies, and ideas to travel safely throughout Eurasia.  International trade and diplomacy along the Silk Road expanded greatly.\\n\\nAround the time of his death in 1227,  Genghis Khan’s empire had gotten too big to survive.  It collapsed under its own size (like Alexander the Great's did in Ancient Greece).  The former Mongol Empire was split four ways.  This allowed the Chinese to become the dominant power in the Far East once again. Later, under the Yuan Dynasty, the Chinese also retook control of northern China.\\n\\nAround 1405, a Chinese admiral named Zheng He went to explore the world. His fleet of 300 'treasure ships' explored great areas of the Eastern world.  These ships were many times larger than anything the Europeans had built. (A Zheng He Treasure ship was wider than Columbus' ship 'Santa Maria' was long).\\n\\nLate Middle Ages \\nThe Late Middle Ages were the last two centuries of the Middle Ages, from around 1291 (when the Crusades ended) to 1492 (when Columbus traveled to the New World). During this period the gun was invented, and changed the way wars were fought.  Aristocracy and feudalism became less important.\\n\\nBefore the late Middle Ages, armies were only formed when there was a war.  Now, states founded standing armies.  Technology, economy and science developed. Cities were founded and existing cities grew larger and richer.\\n\\nDuring the late Middle Ages, France and England fought the Hundred Years' War.  Also during this period, China regained its independence from the Mongol Empire.  So did the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which became the most important state in Eastern Europe, under the name of “Russia.”\\n\\nThe bubonic plague devastated Eurasia and North Africa during the late Middle Ages.  This was one of the deadliest pandemics in history.  It killed between 75 and 200 million people.  This was 1/3 to 3/4 of the world’s population at the time.\\n\\nIn the 15th century, the Ottoman Turks conquered the Byzantine Empire. This cut off the Silk Road, so Europeans had to find new trade routes.  In turn, Christian states drove the Muslims out of Spain.  This triggered the Age of Discovery during the Renaissance.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n Student resources\\n History.com - Middle Ages Articles, Video, Pictures and Facts\\n Middle Ages - Citizendium\\n Middle Ages - Vikidia\\n\\n \\nPeriods and ages in history\",\n",

It has a population of 1.4 million.\\n\\nPrague has been known as one of the most beautiful European cities since the Middle Ages. Often called the \"City of 100 Towers\", the \"Rooftop of Europe\" or the \"Heart of Europe\", Prague was a place where many merchants, artists and inventors met.\\n\\nPrague is full of historical monuments in all major artistic styles. The historical center of Prague is situated on both banks of the Vltava river. This historical center has six districts, which were once independent cities that joined together in the 18th century. These districts are Staré Město (Old Town),  Pražský hrad (Prague castle), Josefov (Old Jewish Town), Nové Město (New Town), Malá Strana (Lesser Town), Hradčany (Prague Castle Quarter) and Vyšehrad. It was Prince Bořivoj who established Prague Castle. There are also lots of museums, galleries, theaters, concert halls, and other historical buildings.\\n\\nHistory \\nThe earliest inhabitants of the area that we know about lived in the valley of the Vltava river around 500 BC. Slavonic tribes came to Bohemia in about 500 AD.  There is a legend about how the town of Prague started.  Princess Libuše, the leader of a Slavonic tribe, chose a simple peasant Přemysl to be her husband.  She told him to go and find a village on the banks of the Vltava and to start a town there.  The town became Prague, ruled by the Přemyslid family.In the second half of the 9th century the castle’s original fortifications were built. During the reign of Wenceslas I (Václav in Czech) in the 10th century the church of St Vitus was built at Prague castle.  Wenceslas was murdered by his brother when he was going to church.  He was later made a saint.  In the early 11th century the Přemyslid family got power in Moravia, too.  Vratislav II was the first monarch to be called King of Bohemia.\\n\\nAnother ruler, also called Wenceslas I, ruled as King of Bohemia from 1230.  He encouraged the arts.  A lot of Germans came to live in Prague.  In 1257 King Otakar II founded the area of Prague called the Lesser Quarter for the Germans to live in.  The last of the Přemyslid kings was King Wenceslas III.  He was murdered in Moravia.\\n\\nDuring the Middle Ages Prague became very important as the capital of the Holy Roman Empire ruled by Charles IV (1316-1378) who was the most powerful ruler in Europe at the time.  Charles made Prague a great city, building St Vitus Cathedral, a university, and a famous bridge called Charles Bridge which still exists.\\n\\nAfter Charles IV there were many arguments and fights in Prague.  A priest called Jan Hus said that the Catholic Church had become too powerful.  He was arrested and burned at the stake in 1415.  A lot of people agreed with what Hus had been saying.  These people were called Hussites.  They threw a lot of important Catholic people out of the window (called \"defenestration\").  A lot more fighting followed, and for many years Bohemia was ruled by kings who lived in other countries.\\n\\nFrom 1526 the Habsburg family ruled Bohemia.  They were Catholics and ruled the Holy Roman Empire.  In 1576 the Emperor Rudolph II moved the capital from Vienna to Prague.  Prague became a rich town again, and people were free to worship as Catholics or Protestants.  After Rudolph II there were a lot of religious fighting and more people were thrown out of windows.  Eventually the fighting became part of the Thirty Years’ War.  When Ferdinand II won the fighting a lot of Protestants left the country.  New buildings in Prague were built in the Baroque style.  The German language, not Czech, was spoken at court.  Maria Theresa was the only queen to reign over Prague.  One of her 16 children was Marie Antoinette who became queen of France.  When her son Joseph II ruled, people stopped fighting about religion.  The people were free to speak what they thought, and there was no more serfdom.  Prague now had three parts: the Old Town, the Lesser Quarter and the New Town.  Famous people such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart visited the town often.\\n\\nIn the 19th century industry came to Prague.  Factories were built, a railway was built between Prague and Vienna.  The Czech nationalist movement became very strong after 1848.  They wanted to use their own language instead of German.  The composers Smetana and Dvořák wrote music about their country, often using Czech folksongs.  The National Theatre was opened in 1881.\\n\\nIn June 1914 the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne, was murdered.  This led to World War I.  After the war an independent republic called Czechoslovakia was formed with Prague as its capital. Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia were part of it.  In 1938 Hitler invaded the country.  It was liberated by Soviet troops in May 1945.  However, the communists soon seized power and the country was ruled by communists who had to obey the Soviet Union.  The prime minister Alexander Dubček gradually tried to make reforms. This period of time is called the \"Prague Spring\". In 1968 the Soviet Union sent tanks into Prague to Wenceslas Square to restore their power.\\n\\nDemocracy gradually came to Prague in 1989 when the Velvet Revolution happened.  In 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia split into two countries.  Today both these countries are part of the European Union.\\n\\nCultural sights \\n\\nSince the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1990 Prague has become one of Europe\\'s most popular tourist places.  It has buildings dating from the 13th century to the present day. The castle looks very important on the hillside.  Charles Bridge is now closed to traffic so that pedestrians can walk across the bridge and buy souvenirs from the stalls.  There are many museums, palaces and theatres.  Tourists often go to the Old Town Square in the centre of Prague.  There are lots of buildings there from different periods of history.  The statue of Jan Hus stands high above the square.  There is a famous Astronomical Clock on the wall of the Old Town Hall.  There are museums dedicated to famous people including Smetana, Dvořák and Franz Kafka.  The Estates Theatre is one of Europe’s oldest theaters.  It was built in the 1780s and Mozart conducted the first performance of his opera Don Giovanni there.\\n\\nPrague is on the list of World Heritage Sites.\\n\\nEconomics \\nPrague has been important in the economy of what is now the Czech Republic since the region developed industry in the 19th century.  Textiles and machinery are made and exported to many countries.  Food, electronics and chemicals are produced.  Nearly half the people who work are women.\\n\\nPrague is becoming a city where many international companies have their headquarters.

       "     'content': 'Symbolism was a late 19th-century art movement of French, Russian and Belgian origin. The movement rejected realism and naturalism, and included poetry and other arts. Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly. Thus a symbolist painting may look realistic, but actually it represents a non-visual idea.\\n\\nIn literature, the style started with the publication Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil, 1857) by Charles Baudelaire. The works of Edgar Allan Poe, which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence and the source of many stock tropes and images. The name \"symbolist\" itself was first used by the critic Jean Moréas, who invented it to distinguish the symbolists from similar styles of literature and art. Symbolism in art is related to the gothic component of Romanticism.\\n\\nThere were several groups of Symbolist painters and visual artists, including Gustave Moreau, Gustav Klimt, Odilon Redon, Henri Fantin-Latour, Gaston Bussière, Edvard Munch, Félicien Rops, and Jan Toorop. Symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry. Its ideas affected Mikhail Vrubel, Nicholas Roerich, Martiros Saryan, Mikhail Nesterov, Léon Bakst, Elena Gorokhova in Russia, as well as Frida Kahlo in Mexico and David Chetlahe Paladin in the United States.  Auguste Rodin is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor.\\n\\nThe symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, symbolism in painting influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau style and Les Nabis.\\n\\nNotes \\n\\nArt movements\\n \\n\\nde:Symbolik',\n",

       "     'content': 'Minimalism is a way of making modern art or music that uses simple ideas, sounds or shapes. It was most popular in America in the 1960s and 1970s. There are many different kinds of minimalism. Sometimes a simple thing is repeated many times until it seems very complicated. Today minimalism can be used to talk about many things such as design, architecture, poetry, and movies.\\n\\nMusic \\nIn music, minimalism is a way of composing classical music which became popular during the second half of the 20th century. It is a way of composing by using a simple idea which is repeated many times. A minimalist piece of music usually takes a short idea which may be a melodic or a rhythmic pattern. This idea is then repeated many times, but each time it changes slightly. Sometimes this may be done by two or more instruments which start off by playing their notes or chords together but, as one is going slightly faster than the other, they gradually become “out of sync” (not synchronized, i.e. not together), then eventually they catch up with one another again. Usually this music is tonal so that it is firmly in one key. A steady pulse is kept throughout the whole piece. \\n\\nComposers who wrote minimalist music include Steve Reich (b.1936), Philip Glass (b.1937) and Terry Riley (b.1935). Other composers like John Adams (b.1947) have also used minimalist ways of composing, but they combined these with other techniques, so that their music is not just minimalist.\\n\\nMinimalist music became popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Minimalist composers started writing like this, also because a lot of new music at that time was very complicated and hard to understand. It was often serial music which was atonal with no obvious melodies or ideas that were easy to remember.\\n\\nMinimalist music is not necessarily simple. It can have a kind of hypnotic effect, but this is part of what the composer wants. Reich’s Clapping Music just consists of hand : there is no melody. He was thinking of African drum music when he wrote it. Two performers begin by clapping a rhythm together. After 13 seconds the second performer leaves out the first quaver (eighth note) and puts it at the end of the second bar (measure). After another 13 seconds this happens again so that in the end the two performers are together again. This music has to be listened to in a different way from other kinds of music.\\n\\nVisual art \\nMinimalism in visual art, sometimes referred to as literalist art and ABC Art emerged in New York in the 1960s. As a product it had much in common with earlier geometric abstraction and suprematism.\\n\\nThe term \"minimalism\" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art called minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such.\\n\\nOne of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was the painter, Frank Stella, whose early \"stripe\" paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show, \"16 Americans\", organized by Dorothy Miller at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas\\'s stripe paintings were determined by the dimensions of the lumber, visible as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side, used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. The decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a \"given\" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, Carl André noted, \"Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes. There is nothing else in his painting\". \\n\\nThese reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and emotionally-charged expressionist paintings of Willem de Kooning or Franz Kline. \\n\\nThey leaned more towards the controlled, somber color field paintings of Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko. Although Stella received immediate attention from the MOMA show, artists like Kenneth Noland, Ralph Humphrey, Robert Motherwell and Robert Ryman had begun to explore stripes, monochromatic and hard-edge formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nMusical movements\\nArt movements',\n",

But these groups work together to agree, so they do not fight and try to make a law if the other does not like it.\\n\\nPower \\nThe European Parliament\\'s power depends on which area of the EU it is working in. The EU has three areas, the \"Community\", its representation to other countries, and things to do with police and courts. In the last two areas, it can not do much as the Council takes care of those issues, but in the Community (which is the largest area) it can change or stop any law. But the Council also has to agree, and sometimes they disagree and cannot make a law.\\n\\nWhile Parliament can change a law, it cannot start a new one, it has to ask the European Commission to do that. The European Commission works on everyday work and the Parliament has to make sure it does its job properly, if it does not Parliament can make them all leave their jobs or not allow them to spend the EU budget.\\n\\nWork \\nWhen the Parliament wants to make a new law, they all vote at the same time. But before then, they make many small changes while talking with experts who know about the things that the new law will change. As in other parliaments, they do this in small meetings known as \"Committees\" of between 28 and 86 MEPs.\\n\\nThe Parliament has a President. The President is elected by the MEPs, two times every two and a half years, to organise the meetings and speak for the Parliament when meeting other leaders. Since 2022, the president has been Roberta Metsola of Malta.\\n\\nHistory \\nThe Parliament was made in 1952 and was then called the \"Common Assembly\". At this time, it did not have any power, it was only asked to comment on laws made by the \"European Coal and Steel Community\". In 1957, it was renamed the \"European Parliamentary Assembly\" and got to comment on the laws of the \"European Economic Community\" and the \"European Atomic Energy Community\". Over the following years, it was given a few powers over laws and money and it called itself the \"European Parliament\" in the 1960s. It wanted to be elected so it could do more, as if people voted for the people in Parliament, the Council and Commission would have to pay more attention to it (this is known as \"Democratic Legitimacy\", the idea that your voice is worth more if you have lots of people supporting from an election).\\n\\nIn 1979 it held its first election, and it gained more powers and also members because more countries joined the Communities and they elected people as well. In 1993 it was given even more, and power over the Commission, when the European Union took the place of the Communities. It is now known as one of the most powerful Parliaments in the world.\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n Official web site\\n Overview on the votes of MEPs \\n European Parliament Office in Ireland\\n UK Office of the European Parliament\\n BBC News: European Parliament guide\\n Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament \\n\\n \\nEuropean Union',\n",

       "     'content': 'The word Bohemian was first used in Paris to mean a Gypsy because many people thought that Gypsies came from Bohemia. The word was then used in the late 19th century (1800s) for poor painters, writers, musicians and actors who often travelled to Paris from other towns and tried to earn money. Paris was a famous town for painters, writers, and musicians to gather, to learn from each other and to enjoy the life of the city. Many of them lived at Montmartre, not far from the \"Moulin Rouge\". One of the most famous painters to live in Montmartre was Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. He loved to paint the can-can dancers and prostitutes. He did many posters to advertise the nightclubs. The posters are now famous works of art. \\n\\nIn the 20th century the word \"Bohemian\" spread to other countries and was used to describe the lives of many different artists of different sorts. The sort of behaviour that was thought of as \"Bohemian\" included whether a person had a regular job, how they dressed, their political views, their religious views, their sexual behaviour and the entertainment they liked. \\n\\nPeople who were called \"Bohemians\" were often very poor, because they tried to live by painting, acting or writing. It was hard to make a living. They generally wore old or second-hand clothing, and could not afford a good hair-cut. They often shared the room in the roof of a house, which was cheap, because it was cold in winter, hot in summer and often had birds living there as well. In some ways the life of a bohemian artist was difficult, but it gave people freedom to express themselves, that was often not found in more conservative society, where everyone worried about what other people thought of them, and cared a lot about things like clothes and houses. Sometimes students from richer families would come to live a \"Bohemian life style\", so that they could feel the same freedom to express themselves.  \\n\\nDuring the 20th century, many cities apart from Paris have areas where people have lived Bohemian lifestyles. One of the problems is that these areas often become fashionable for rich people. This soon drives away the poor artists and students, because they can no longer afford the rent.\\n\\nBohemian areas \\n                \\n\\nBohemian areas in different cities are: \\n Paris- Montmartre and Montparnasse \\n Istanbul- Pera (Beyoglu)\\n London- Chelsea, Camden Town, and Soho\\n Munich- Schwabing \\n Belgrade- Skadarlija \\n Madrid- Lavapiés in Madrid \\n Milan- Isola and Colonne di San Lorenzo \\n New York City- Greenwich Village, the East Village and Chelsea\\n Massachusetts- Provincetown \\n California- Carmel-by-the-Sea, \\n San Francisco- the Mission District \\n Chicago- Logan Square \\n New Orleans- the French Quarter \\n Toronto- Kensington Market \\n Mexico City- Coyoacán and Condesa \\n Sydney- Kings Cross and Newtown\\n Tokyo - Shimokitazawa \\n Vancouver- Commercial Drive\\n\\nBohemians in culture \\n Bohemian people and places have very often been shown in paintings.

       "     'content': 'Pierre-Auguste Renoir (25 February 1841 – 3 December 1919) was a French artist. He was a leading painter who helped to create the Impressionist style. He painted portraits, and still life, but above all, he painted social scenes of the day. \\n\\nAs a painter of women, it has been said that \"Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau\".\\n\\nYouth \\nPierre-Auguste Renoir was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne, France, the child of a working class family. As a boy, he worked in a porcelain factory where his drawing talents led to him being chosen to paint designs on fine china. He also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans before he enrolled in art school. During those early years, he often visited the Louvre to study the French master painters.\\n\\nMaturity \\n\\nIn the late 1860s, through the practice of painting light and water en plein air (in the open air), he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect today known as diffuse reflection. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet, working side-by-side, depicted the same scenes (La Grenouillère, 1869). \\n\\nRenoir experienced his initial acclaim when six of his paintings hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. In the same year, two of his works were shown with Paul Durand-Ruel in London.\\n\\nOne of the best known Impressionist works is Renoir\\'s 1876 Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (Bal du moulin de la Galette). The painting depicts an open-air scene, crowded with people, at a popular dance garden on the Butte Montmartre, close to where he lived.\\nThe works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life, full of sparkling colour and light.\\n\\nA trip to Italy in 1881, when he saw works by Raphael and other Renaissance masters, that convinced him that he was on the wrong path. For the next several years he painted in a more severe, classical, style. After 1890, however, he changed direction again, returning to thinly brushed colour to dissolve outlines as in his earlier work. From this period onward he concentrated on nudes and domestic scenes.\\n\\nA prolific artist, he made several thousand paintings. The warm sensuality of Renoir\\'s style made his paintings some of the most well-known and reproduced works in the history of art. The single largest collection of his works—181 paintings in all—is at the Barnes Foundation, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \\n\\nIn 1890, he married Aline Victorine Charigot. She, with a number of the artist\\'s friends, had been a model for Le Déjeuner des canotiers (Luncheon of the Boating Party, 1881). They already had a child, Pierre, in 1885. After his marriage, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life, including their children and their nurse, Aline\\'s cousin. The Renoirs had three sons, one of whom, Jean, became a film director of note and another, Pierre, became a stage and film actor.\\n\\nOld age \\n\\nAround 1892, Renoir developed rheumatoid arthritis. In 1907, he moved to the warmer climate of \"Les Collettes,\" a farm at Cagnes-sur-Mer, close to the Mediterranean coast. Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life, even when arthritis severely limited his movement, and he was wheelchair-bound. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder, requiring him to adapt his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers, but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand. The wrapping of his hands with bandages, apparent in late photographs of the artist, served to prevent skin irritation.\\n\\nDuring this period, he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, Richard Guino, who worked the clay. Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to help him paint large works.\\n\\nIn 1919, Renoir visited the Louvre to see his paintings hanging with the old masters. He died in the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence-Alpes-Côte d\\'Azur, on 3 December.\\n\\nGallery\\n\\nRelated pages \\n List of French painters\\n\\nReferences \\n\\n1841 births\\n1919 deaths\\nFrench painters\\nPeople from Limoges\\nImpressionist painters',\n",

More than 1,800,000 people live there (2016). It is an administrative district (Bundesland) of its own.\\n\\nBefore World War I, it was the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe history of the city goes back to the Roman Empire. The Romans started a military camp called Vindobona. The camp was in today's first district on the Danube river. The name came from the Celts, so there was probably a Celtic settlement before the Roman invasion. The Romans stayed until the 5th century. In medieval times, the settlement was still in use. The present name was mentioned in 881 in the Salzburger Annalen, where a battle ad weniam is mentioned.\\n\\nIn 976 the House of Babenberg became rulers of the area. They made Vienna their capital in 1155. Vienna was already an important city. In 1156, Austria became a Duchy, and Vienna was where the Duke who ruled the Duchy lived. In 1221, Vienna got municipal rights.  It Is the second oldest city in Austria (Enns, in Upper Austria, is the oldest).\\n\\nIn 1278, the Duchy came to the Habsburg family. Rudolf IV started the university in 1365 and while he was duke the nave of the Gothic St. Stephan's Cathedral was built. Quarrels within the Hapsburg family caused an economic decline in Vienna. In 1438, Vienna became the residence of the Holy Roman Emperor.\\n\\nDuring the time of the reformation Vienna was a Protestant city, but in the times of the Counter Reformation, Austria and Vienna were mostly Roman Catholic.\\n\\nIn 1529, Vienna was first besieged by the army of the Ottoman Empire, which had a border only 150\\xa0km east of Vienna. This hurt Vienna economically, but led to people fortifying the city (making it stronger). After a second siege, the Ottoman Empire could not take Vienna, and the city started getting larger.\\n\\nDuring the baroque era, Vienna was rebuilt. Many residences for the nobility were built. Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach was an important architect in Vienna.\\n\\nAt the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century Vienna was the home of important composers like Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert.\\n\\nAfter the revolution in 1848 Franz Joseph I. became emperor of the Austrian Empire, which was founded in 1806 after the liquidation of the Holy Roman Empire. He ruled till 1916. Vienna became a center of arts, culture and architecture. The city grew because the suburbs became part of the city. After 1858 the walls of the city were destroyed and the Ringstraße replaced them. Along that street houses of the rich citizens were built, as were public buildings like the city hall and the Burg theatre. The industrialisation started at the beginning of the century and made more people live there. In 1870, Vienna had one million people, and in 1910, two million people. With the creation of a large working class and poverty in Vienna the Labour Party (Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei) became stronger.\\n\\nKarl Lueger was the most important mayor in the time of Emperor Franz Josef. During his time important community plans were realized that made Vienna a modern city. However, Lueger was a radical anti-Semite. He was admired by the young Adolf Hitler, who spent some years before the First World War in Vienna. At this time, Vienna was an important place for the arts. Composers like Arnold Schönberg, Anton Webern, Alban Berg and Ernst Krenek were important for the development of modern music. Also the  psychoanalysis was founded in Vienna by Sigmund Freud. Also the so-called Jugendstil in arts was part of Vienna's modern arts scene. Founding fathers of modern architecture lived and worked also in Vienna at this time (Otto Wagner, Adolf Loos)\\n\\nAfter the end of the First World War the Austrian-Hungary Empire was dissolved and Vienna became capital of the Republic of Austria. In 1938, Austria was occupied by Germany. In Vienna the suffering of the Jewish inhabitants began. A lot of their properties was given to Austrians (Arisierung).\\n\\nAfter the Second World War, which destroyed 20% of Vienna's buildings, Vienna was divided into four parts. The city was controlled by the allies like the other parts of Austria. In 1955 the state treaty between the allies and Austria was signed in Vienna's Belvedere. After that Vienna became an important city for international organisations. The first was 1957 the International Atomic Energy Organisation (IAEO) and 1965 the OPEC followed. 1980 the Vienna International Center was opened and Vienna is now the third UN-city together with New York and Geneva.\\n\\nDistricts \\nThere are 23 districts in Vienna.

Here are a few of them.\\nSt. Stephen's cathedral and St. Stephen's Square:\\n Today St. Stephen's square with the cathedral is the very center of Vienna. The Graben and the Kärntner Straße which lead away from the square are shopping streets with a lot of different shops. Opposite the cathedral you can find the Haas-House, a very modern building by the architect Hans Hollein. \\nRingstraße:\\nThe Ringstraße runs around the first district and was built in the second half of the 19th century. The street follows the old city walls which were destroyed to create it. Along the street you can find different important buildings like the Staatsoper (opera house), the parliament, the Burgtheater, the two museums of natural history and arts. Also, the Wiener Postsparkasse which is an important building by the architect Otto Wagner is along the street.\\nHofburg:\\nFrom the 13th century to 1918 this was the residence of the Habsburg rulers. Today it is the residence of the President of the Republic of Austria and you can also visit different museums like the Schatzkammer where you can see the different crowns of the Habsburg family and the crown of the Holy Roman Empire. The National Library is also the Hofburg. \\nSchönbrunn Palace:\\nToday's buildings were built by the architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach an important architect in the baroque era in Austria. Another building of Fischer is the Karlskirche.\\nSchloss Belvedere:\\nSchloss Belvedere was built by Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt another important Austrian baroque architect. It was built for Prinz Eugen of Savoy who fought successfully against the Ottoman Empire. Today the castle is used as museum (Austrian Gallery Belvedere).\\n\\nCulture \\n\\nThere are many old buildings, churches and museums in the city centre. Classical music and opera are popular in Vienna. The composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Brahms all worked in Vienna. Vivaldi also died in Vienna.

He made solid objects from stone or clay. His most famous works are \\'The Thinker\\' and \\'The Kiss\\'.\\n\\nAlthough Rodin is generally considered the start of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. His training was old-school. He took a craftsman-like approach to his work, but he was rejected three times to Paris\\'s foremost school of art.\\n\\nRodin had a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in clay. Many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with the sculpture tradition, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic.\\n\\nRodin\\'s most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory. He modelled the human body with realism, with individual character and physicality. Rodin refused to change his style. Gradually there came increasing favour from the government and the artistic community.\\n\\nHis statue of writer Honoré de Balzac for the Société des Gens des Lettres was heavily criticised. Rather than try to convince skeptics of its merit, Rodin repaid the Société his commission and moved the figure to his own garden. After this experience, Rodin did not complete another public commission. Only in 1939 was Monument to Balzac cast in bronze. It is now thought to be a masterpiece.\\n\\nRodin\\'s reputation grew, and he became the top French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Rich private clients sought Rodin\\'s work after his 1900 World\\'s Fair exhibit. For example, a Japanese patron, Matsukata Kojiro, paid for some of Rodin\\'s best castings, including \"The Gates of Hell.\"\\n\\nRodin kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists.

       "     'content': 'Italy ( [iˈtaːlja])  is a country in Southern Europe. It is a member of the European Union. Its official name is Repubblica Italiana.  The Italian flag is green, white and red. Italy is a democratic republic.\\n\\nItaly is a founding member of the European Union. Its president is Sergio Mattarella. Its prime minister is Mario Draghi. Italy is also a member of the G7, as it has the eighth largest gross domestic product in the world.\\n\\nItaly has become famous for its wine and its food. Some foods are different between regions. Famous dishes include various types of pasta, pizza, and grapes. Olives are much used.\\n\\nIn the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Greeks began a large colonization drive, including southern Italy such as Magna Graecia. This was because of various reasons, including demographic crisis (famine, overcrowding, climate change, etc.), the search for new commercial outlets and ports, and expulsion from their homeland.\\n\\nBefore 1861, Italy was made up of smaller kingdoms and city-states.\\n\\nThe country\\'s capital, Rome, is one of the most famous cities in the world. It was the capital of the Roman Empire. Other famous cities in Italy include, Venice, Naples, Turin, Genoa, Florence, Palermo, and Milan.\\n\\nGeography\\n\\nItaly is a peninsula. It is surrounded by the sea on all of its sides except its north side. Northern Italy is separated from France, Switzerland, and Austria by the Alps, a chain of mountains. Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco in Italian or white mountain in English), the highest mountain in Western Europe, is in this chain. The second important chain of mountains in Italy is the Apennines (), which are in central and southern Italy.\\n\\nThe Po River is the longest river in Italy. It flows through 5 cities: Turin, Piacenza, Cremona, and Ferrara. The Tiber River runs through the city of Rome.\\n\\nNorthern Italy has some of the biggest lakes in the country, such as Lake Garda, Lake Como, Lake Maggiore and Lake Iseo. Because it is surrounded by the sea, Italy has many kilometers of coast, which brings tourists from all over the world.  Tourists also come to see Italy\\'s historical places.\\n\\nThe country has a number of islands, the biggest of which are Sicily and Sardinia, which can be reached by ship or aircraft. Italy shares maritime borders with Libya to the south.\\n\\nPolitical geography\\n\\nThe capital of Italy is Rome. That is where the Roman Empire started. Other cities in Italy are Milan, Turin, Florence, Genoa, Naples, Palermo, and Venice.\\n\\nTwo enclaves (separate countries) are located within Italy. They are San Marino, which is surrounded by part of Northern Italy, and the Vatican City, which is inside Rome.\\n\\nPeople and culture \\n\\nPeople from Italy are called Italians. Even if an Italian were to leave Italy, it is possible that their descendants could also claim Italian citizenship. This is because of Italian nationality law relying mostly on ius sanguinis or \"right of blood\" in Latin. Almost all Italians are Christians. Most of these are Roman Catholics. Roman Catholicism is based in the Vatican City, which is home to its leader, the Pope.\\n\\nThe population of Italy is a little over 60 million. About 2.7 million of them live in Rome, and 1.3 million in Milan. As of 31 December 2015, over 5 million foreigners were living in Italy, which is 8.3% of the total population.\\n\\nThe official language of Italy is Italian. German, Slovenian, French, and a few others are also recognized. People also speak dialects of Italian such as Sicilian and Sardinian.  There are many different dialects spoken in Italy.  They vary between regions and sometimes between provinces.\\n\\nThe people of Italy are mostly descendant from the ancient Romans.\\n\\nItaly is home to more World Heritage Sites than any other country in the world. These sites are culturally important and valued according to UNESCO. About 60% of the works of art of the world are in Italy. Italy is also a big wine producer. In 2005 it made over 5 million tonnes.\\n\\nFood\\nFamous Italian foods include pasta or pizza.\\n\\nArt\\nMany notable artists were from Italy. They include:\\n Donatello, sculptor\\n Leonardo da Vinci, painter\\n Michelangelo, sculptor and painter\\n Amedeo Modigliani, painter\\n Raphael\\n\\nEconomy \\n\\nItaly has a modern social welfare system. The labor market is relatively strength. Many foreigners, especially from Romania, work in Italy where the wages are much higher. But there could have been much more workers on the labor market because men and women already retired in the age of 57 and the unemployment rate is relatively high at 8.2 percent.\\n\\nItaly\\'s modern society has been built up through loans. Now the country has a very high debt of 1.9 trillion euros or 120 percent of the country\\'s total GDP. The government cannot pay back the loans during the time period the EU wants.\\n\\nReligion \\n\\nMost people in Italy are Roman Catholics, but the Catholic Church is no longer officially the state religion. 87.8% of the people said they were Roman Catholic.\\nOnly about a third said they were active members (36.8%). There are also other Christian groups in Italy, more than 700,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians. 180,000 of them belong to the Greek Orthodox Church.\\n\\n550,000 are Pentecostals and Evangelicals (0.8%). 235,685 Jehovah\\'s Witnesses (0.4%), 30,000 Waldensians, 25,000 Seventh-day Adventists, 22,000 Mormons, 20,000 Baptists, 7,000 Lutherans, 4,000 Methodists.\\nThe country\\'s oldest religious minority is the Jewish community. It has roughly 45,000 people. It is no longer the largest non-Christian group.\\nAbout 825,000 Muslims live in Italy. Most of them immigrated. (1.4% of the total population) Only 50,000 are Italian citizens. In addition, there are 50,000 Buddhists 70,000 Sikh and 70,000 Hindus in Italy.\\n\\nMajor cities \\n\\n Rome\\n Venice\\n Milan\\n Naples\\n Turin\\n Florence\\n Bologna\\n Palermo\\n Trieste\\n Bari\\n\\nRegions \\nItaly has 20 regions (). Every region is divided into provinces.\\n\\nThere are 20 regions. Five of them have a special status, called autonomous. This means that they can make certain local laws more easily. These regions are marked with an asterisk (*) below.\\n\\nPolitics \\n\\nThe head of state is Sergio Mattarella. He became President of the Italian Republic in February 2015. The first president was Enrico De Nicola.\\n\\nThe head of government is Mario Draghi. He became Prime Minister on February 13, 2021. He succeeded Giuseppe Conte. Conte\\'s cabinet, fell after a political crisis caused by Italia Viva, a liberal political party.\\n\\nItaly was one of the first members of the European Union. In 2002 along with 11 other European countries, it changed to using the euro as its official currency. Before this, the Italian lira had been used since 1861.\\n\\nAnyone who wants to be President of Italy must have Italian citizenship, be at least 50 years old, and must be able to hold political and civil rights.\\n\\nHistory \\n\\nIn ancient times, the capital of Italy was Rome. Rome was founded in 753 BC. It  was a separate state well known as Roman Kingdom firstly, Roman Republic and Roman Empire later.\\n\\nBefore 1861, Italy was not a state.  The area included a group of separate states that were ruled by other countries (such as Austria, France, and Spain).  In the 1850s, the Earl of Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour was the head of government of the \"State of Sardinia\". He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state.\\n\\nKingdom of Italy \\n\\nIn 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi took control of Sicily, creating the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Victor Emmanuel II was made the king. In 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were ruled by the Pope and Austrian Empire.\\n\\nVeneto was made part of Italy in 1866 after a war with Austria. Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870. That was when they took away the Pope\\'s power. The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep Catholic people from being active in politics. That was the year of Italian unification.\\n\\nItaly participated in World War I. It was an ally of Great Britain, France, and Russia against the Central Powers. Almost all of Italy\\'s fighting was on the Eastern border, near Austria. After the \"Caporetto defeat\", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers surrendered. Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria.\\n\\nFascist Italy \\nIn 1922, a new Italian government started. It was ruled by Benito Mussolini, the leader of Fascism in Italy. He became head of government and dictator, calling himself \"Il Duce\" (which means \"leader\" in Italian). He became friends with German dictator Adolf Hitler. Germany, Japan, and Italy became the Axis Powers. In 1940, they entered World War II together against France, Great Britain, and later the Soviet Union. During the war, Italy controlled most of the Mediterranean Sea.\\n\\nOn July 25, 1943, Mussolini was removed by the Great Council of Fascism. On September 8, 1943, Badoglio said that the war as an ally of Germany was ended. Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK, but Italian soldiers did not know whom to shoot. In Northern Italy, a movement called Resistenza started to fight against the German invaders. On April 25, 1945, much of Italy became free, while Mussolini tried to make a small Northern Italian fascist state called the Republic of Salò. The fascist state failed and Mussolini tried to flee to Switzerland and escape to Francoist Spain, but he was captured by Italian partisans. On 28 April 1945 Mussolini was executed by a partisan.\\n\\nAfter World War Two \\n\\nThe state became a republic on June 2, 1946. For the first time, women were able to vote. Italian people ended the Savoia dynasty and adopted a republic government.\\n\\nIn February 1947, Italy signed a peace treaty with the Allies. They lost all the colonies and some territorial areas (Istria and parts of Dalmatia).\\n\\nSince then Italy has joined NATO and the European Community (as a founding member). It is one of the seven biggest industrial economies in the world.\\n\\nTransportation \\n\\nThe railway network in Italy totals . It is the 17th longest in the world. High speed trains include ETR-class trains which travel at .\\n\\nRelated pages\\n Italy at the Olympics\\n Italy national football team\\n Italian cuisine\\n Italophilia\\n Italian Mare Nostrum\\n List of rivers of Italy\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n Italian Tourism Official Website\\n\\n \\nEuropean Union member states\\nItalian-speaking countries\\nG8 nations\\nG7 nations',\n",

       "     'content': 'The Berlin Wall (German: Berliner Mauer) was a wall that separated the city of Berlin in Germany from 1961 to 1989. It separated the eastern half from the western half. Many people thought it was a symbol of the Cold War. The Berlin Wall was taken down on November 9, 1989. The Berlin Wall was about  long. It was built to prevent people from escaping from the eastern half of Berlin.\\n\\nDivision of Germany \\n\\nAfter World War II ended, Germany was divided into four zones, one zone for each of the main Allied countries: France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union. Its capital Berlin was also divided into four zones, so that it was an enclave, like an island inside the Soviet zone. On May 8, 1949, the French, United Kingdom and US zones were made into West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany, Bundesrepublik Deutschland, BRD) and West Berlin. The Soviet zones were made into East Germany and East Berlin. East Germany (German Democratic Republic, Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR) was founded on October 7, 1949. Europe, Germany and Berlin were divided by an iron curtain.\\n\\nWhat led to the building of the wall \\n\\nAfter Germany split into West and East Germany on May 8, 1949, 2.6 million East Germans left to go to West Germany. In Berlin alone, 3.6 million people fled to the west. To stop this, on August 13, 1961, the Communist government of East Germany built a wall separating East and West Berlin.\\n\\nThe wall was built to keep the country\\'s people in. But the Soviets and East German government said it was to keep capitalism out. They said that West Germany refused to recognize East Germany as an independent country because they wanted to take over North-East Germany just like Hitler took over Poland.\\n\\nPeople still tried to escape even though the Berlin Wall was there. They used many methods to get around the guards and barbed wire on the Berlin Wall.\\n\\nIn the late 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev said that the Soviet Union would not use the Red Army to stop the people of Eastern and Middle Europe from changing their government. After he said that, several countries began to change the way they governed their people. Hungary opened its border and people from East Germany began moving to the west through Hungary. In October 1989 mass demonstrations against the government in East Germany began. The long-time leader, Erich Honecker, resigned and was replaced by Egon Krenz a few days later. Honecker had predicted in January 1989 that the wall would stand for a \"hundred more years\" if the conditions which had caused its construction did not change. This did not turn out to be true.\\n\\nIn November, 1989, the Central Committee of East Germany decided to make it easier for East Germans to pass through the wall. A mistake by the press officer meant the border was opened several hours before it should have been. Millions of East German citizens celebrated the opening of the wall. Many collected souvenirs with chisels and some television stations filmed people hitting the wall with sledge hammers.\\n\\nThis image of people in West Berlin hitting the wall is often said to be East Berliners breaking out. This is not true. The eastern side of the wall had no graffiti on it. All pictures of people chipping away at the wall show people hitting graffiti covered walls. Less than one year after the Berlin Wall was broken down, Germany again became one country.\\n\\nDeath toll \\nIn the 28 years of its existence, between 125 and 206 people were killed when trying to cross the Berlin Wall. At least 800 more people were killed outside Berlin, trying to cross from East Germany to the west.\\n\\nThe East Germans did not record all of the deaths, so the real number of how many people died may never be known.\\n\\nThose people who were caught alive in an attempt to flee, had to go to jail for at least five years. The first victim of the Wall was Ida Siekmann. She was fatally injured after jumping out of the window of her apartment. She fell onto the pavement on the west side. The first victim of the Wall to be shot at was Günter Litfin. He was 24 years old and was shot by police, near the railway station of Berlin Friedrichstrasse, when he tried to get into the West. This was on 24 August, 1961, only eleven days after the border had been closed.\\n\\nPeter Fechter bled to death in the death strip, on 17 August, 1962. This led to a public outcry. American troops watched him, but could not help him. The East-German border policemen, who had wounded him, did not help him either.\\n\\nIn 1966, two children, aged ten and thirteen years, were killed in the border strip. This is unusual because the East German border police had orders to not shoot on pregnant women, children or mentally ill people.\\n\\nOn 6 February, 1989, border guards shot and killed Chris Gueffroy as he tried to cross the wall. He was the last person to be killed by border guards. On 8 March, 1989, Winfried Freudenberg died after falling from a gas balloon. He was the last person to die trying to cross the Berlin Wall and escape into West Berlin.\\n\\nThe Riots of Berlin\\n \\nThe Berlin wall eventually started to fall once people rioted. Many jumped on top of the wall, and even crowded against it. This caused the wall to collapse in some areas, and more people could get through to the refugee camps that were set up on the other side.  \"Tear down this wall!\" was a speech made by United States President Ronald Reagan to Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev to destroy the wall. The speech was made at the Brandenburg Gate near the Berlin Wall on June 12, 1987. It was made to honor the 750th anniversary of Berlin. His speech and its fallout might have aided in the wall\\'s demolition.\\n\\nFall of the Wall \\nBy late 1989 the GDR was suffering from many problems such as a struggling economy, and large-scale protests. The Hungarian regime had collapsed and  was dismantling its border fences with Austria by August 1989. Since the Warsaw Pact allowed citizens to travel within the Soviet bloc, many East German tourists fled to the west via Hungary. When the Hungarian government refused the GDR\\'s demand to stop defectors, East Germany banned all travel to Hungary; prompting demonstrations and protest. This began the GDR\\'s isolation within the bloc.\\n\\nErich Honecker, leader of the GDR since 1971, was forced to resign on October 18, 1989.   He was replaced by Egon Krenz after a unanimous vote by the politburo. Under Krenz\\'s regime, East Germans could still escape to Hungary via Czechoslovakia.\\n\\nThe number of defectors grew and caused tensions between East Germany and Czechoslovakia. The Krenz regime decided to allow people to leave directly to the west through border checkpoints in East Berlin. This prompted many East Germans, who learned about it broadcast from West German media, to go to the border crossings and demand to be let through immediately.\\n\\nBorder guards at each checkpoint told the people to go back home as they had no orders that the wall would open that night. As time passed, the number of people arriving at the checkpoint was increasing and the guards were becoming alarmed. They began taking the more aggressive people aside and stamped their passports with a special stamp that allowed them access to West Berlin however, the people were not aware that they were effectively revoking their East German citizenship and were shocked to be refused entry back into the GDR. The Chief Guard of the checkpoint frantically telephoned his superiors hoping to get answers as to why so many people thought that the wall was to open. By 22:45, it was clear that the outnumbered and overwhelmed border guards would not use their weapons to suppress the crowds. The Chief Guard surrendered and ordered the gates to West Berlin to be opened. The crowds of East Berliners were met with crowds of West Berliners in a happy scene as the Berlin wall had just fallen.\\n\\nMany people even climbed up onto the wall by the Brandenburg Gate in protest and began to chisel away at the wall. The GDR authorities responded to this initially by blasting the people with water cannons; this proved to be ineffective. The East German army later climbed up onto the wall to prevent others from standing on the wall. The government began demolishing the wall the next day. The fall of the wall destroyed the SED, the ruling party of the GDR, and caused many of its officials to resign. The German Democratic Republic would cease to exist less than a year later; reuniting with the Federal Republic of Germany on October 3, 1990.\\n\\nWhat the wall was made of \\n\\nThe wall was changed and added to several times. It was not really a wall, but a collection of walls and fences and other devices. This is what the border fence was made of, starting from the east, going west\\n\\n Concrete wall or wire fence, 2–3 meters high\\n Signalling system in the floor, which would cause an alarm to be sounded when touched\\n Contact wire fence with barbed wire fence. Taller than a man.\\n (Not in all places) Kennels for dogs. With German Shepherd Dogs or other trained dogs.\\n (Not in all places) Equipment and trenches to stop vehicles and tanks. These systems would be removed (if the West paid for the removal). Most were replaced later.\\n Streets to get replacements and reinforcements in.\\n Watchtowers (in 1989 there were 302 of them). Including searchlights\\n death strip. This was an area in which all of the buildings were torn down, with nowhere to hide. Sometimes there were strips of sand where footprints could be detected.\\n Metallic fence, then the border itself:\\n Concrete wall, 3.75 metres in height. Very hard to climb.\\n\\nThe whole was done in an a zone of between 30 and 500 m wide. The official (civil border) began before the first fence. Entering the installation required a special permit. The real border was about one or two metres in front of the concrete wall, so that the whole of the wall complex was inside East Germany (only the East Berlin part of the wall was inside East Berlin).\\n\\nThe border between East Germany and West Germany was also heavily defended with fences and mines. East Germans needed a special permit to live close to the border.\\n\\nWhat is left today \\n\\nAfter the Reunification of Germany in October 3, 1990, the Berlin Wall was demolished and taken away. A few sections of the wall remain; some of the sections became a museum.\\n Of the total of 302 watchtowers, 5 are left.\\n The so-called Todesstreifen (death zone) can still be seen in many places. Some of them are large areas of brown, uncultivated land. Sometimes they are now parks.\\n There is a private museum at Checkpoint Charlie.\\n There is a cemetery near Checkpoint Charlie, remembering the victims of the Wall.\\n\\nControversies \\nThe East Berlin special police who guarded the wall had the order to shoot if this was necessary to stop people fleeing. East German leaders such as Egon Krenz were arrested after German reunification because guards were ordered to shoot to kill.\\n\\nHowever, after the Wall was built, many people were no longer able to leave East Berlin using normal border posts. The only way they could do so was to race through the Wall or try to dig a tunnel underneath.\\n\\nAfter the unification of Germany, border guards who had shot people were convicted by West German Courts. The judges said, that some of the laws of the border police (about shooting) were against human rights. They therefore should have refused to shoot.\\n\\nThe same was of course applied to those people who had shot border police on their flight.\\n\\nBorder guards who did shoot, and stop someone from fleeing could get a reward of up to 500 Marks. Some of those guards were sentenced after the unification.\\n\\nThe other choice was to not shoot, or to miss badly. Such guards risked losing their well-paid jobs.\\n\\nCuriosities \\n In 1988, there was a swapping of territory between East and West Berlin. Some territory, called the Lenné triangle (near Potsdamer Platz), was now part of the West. A few days after the swap, a group of ecology protestors fled from the western police into East Berlin, over the Wall. They were given a meal and sent back by the border guards.\\n\\nAnother strip of land was given to West Berlin. This strip was only the width of a road which joined West Berlin with a tiny exclave.\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Iron Curtain\\n Ich bin ein Berliner\\n Tear down this wall!\\n Wende\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n www.wall-berlin.org\\n Berlin Wall Fotos an More (In German)\\n Retracing the Berlin Wall \\n Bernauer Straße Memorial website \\n Allied Forces in Berlin (FR, UK & US Berlin Brigade)\\n Photographs of time of the Fall as well as updates on the current situation in Germany\\n Reports on reinforcements to Berlin Brigade\\n \"Berlin 1969\" includes sections on Helmstedt-Berlin rail operations.\\n Includes articles on rail transport for Berlin during the Cold War.

       "     'content': 'Gothic cathedrals are important examples of gothic architecture. Gothic architecture was a way of planning and designing buildings that began in Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages. Gothic architecture grew out of Romanesque architecture, in France in the 12th century. The architecture spread across Europe and lasted until the 16th century when Renaissance architecture became popular. \\n\\nThe single most characteristic feature of Gothic architecture is the pointed arch. This is the main difference from Romanesque architecture which had rounded arches. Other important features are the ribbed vault, flying buttress, and windows with patterns of stone lace called tracery. \\n\\nMany of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe are Gothic architecture. It is also the architecture of many castles, and palaces. It is also found in some  town halls, universities, and some houses.\\n\\nMany church buildings still remain from this time. Even the smallest Gothic churches are often beautiful, while many of the larger Gothic churches and cathedrals are thought to be priceless works of art. Many are listed with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as World Heritage Sites.\\n\\nIn the 19th century, the Gothic style became popular again, particularly for building churches and universities. This style is called Gothic Revival architecture.\\n\\nAbout the word \"Gothic\" \\nGothic architecture was at first called \"the French Style\" ().\\nThe word \"Gothic\" was used later during the Renaissance as an insult, relating to the uncivilized ancient Goths, Germanic-people documented living near lower Vistula river.\\n\\nAn Italian writer named Giorgio Vasari used the word \"Gothic\" in the 1530s, because he thought buildings from the Middle Ages were not carefully planned and measured like Renaissance buildings or the buildings of ancient Rome. He said that, as the barbaric Goths had destroyed the classical world, so this \"modern art\" had destroyed the architecture of the twelfth century.  After Vasari, many other people used the word \"Gothic\" to describe architecture with pointed arches.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nTowns, states and countries\\nAt the end of the 12th century, Western Europe was divided into different states. Many of these were beginning to become the countries that exist today. \\n\\nThe Holy Roman Empire ruled a big part of Europe including the modern countries of Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, eastern France and much of northern Italy, apart from Venice. Emperor Charlemagne began the Holy Roman Empire in 800 AD.\\n\\nThe modern countries of France and Spain were each divided into different kingdoms. England was ruled by a king whose family also had a lot of land in France. Norway was influenced by England, while the other Scandinavian countries and Poland were influenced by German states.\\n\\nTrade between towns and states began to make the towns grow larger. Germany, Holland and Belgium had many big towns that grew peacefully, often trading with each other. Because of the peace and wealth of these towns, they showed their pride by building huge town halls, often with very tall towers.\\n\\nIn England and France, most people did not live in towns. They lived on farms. Rich nobleman or lord owned these farms. The house of the lord was called a manor house. Italy was mostly split up into small city states which often fought each other. Cities often had high walls and many of the houses built at this time were tall, high towers.\\n\\nThe Church \\nIn Western Europe, in the Middle Ages, almost everyone belonged to the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church has one head - the Pope. During the Middle Ages, one language was used in churches all across Europe - Ecclesiastical Latin, sometimes called Church Latin, which had developed from ancient Latin. \\nThe churches of each area had a local bishop who came under the Pope. . Each Bishop had a throne where he could sit when priests and people came to him. A church which has a Bishop\\'s throne is called a \"cathedral\". Cathedrals were usually the biggest and most beautiful churches.\\n\\nIn the early Middle Ages, many monasteries were built all over Europe. A group of holy men lived and worked and prayed there.  Monks belonged to different \"orders\" which had different rules. The biggest number of monasteries were homes to the monks of the Benedictine Order. Their monasteries were generally in towns and they often built very big churches called \"Abbeys\" for the monks and the townspeople to worship in. Other orders of monks, like the Cistercians, did not live near towns. Nowadays their abbeys are seen as beautiful ruins in the English countryside.\\n\\nIn France, there were also Benedictines, as well as Cluniac Orders. The great monastery at Cluny, built in the Romanesque style, was the biggest in Europe. The abbey and other buildings were very well planned so for hundreds of years other monasteries were influenced by that plan.\\n\\nIn the 13th century St. Francis of Assisi started the Franciscans, who were often called the \"Grey Friars\" because of their grey-brown robes.  The Dominicans were founded by St. Dominic in Toulouse and Bologna. The Dominicans built many of Italy\\'s Gothic churches.\\n\\nAbbot Suger and the first Gothic building\\nAbbot Suger was the head of a large monastery just north of Paris in France. The monastery had a large church, the Abbey of Saint-Denis. There was also a royal palace where the French kings sometimes stayed. Abbot Suger was a close friend to two kings, Louis VI and Louis VII.\\n\\nIn 1127 Suger decided to rebuild the great abbey Church of Saint-Denis. He began by changing the \"West Front\" or facade This side of the church was about 200 years old and had only one small door. Suger planned for three big doors like the arches on the Arch of Constantine in Rome. These large entrances let in all the crowds on special Holy Days. The facade also had a big round window in the centre, called a rose window, which was the first one in France.\\n\\nAbbot Suger did not rebuild the church inside the west doors where most of the ordinary people stood. Next, he rebuilt the eastern end. Suger wanted the east facade to make people think of Heaven. He wanted it to be very light and bright, with very big windows of beautifully coloured glass. He looked at all the most modern designs, and all the clever things that other architects had done. He put all the new ideas together in one building. It was the first building of the new \"Gothic\" style. It was not yet called Gothic at this time. It was called \"the French Style\".\\n\\nThe new East End was dedicated or \"given to God\" on June 11, 1144. Other architects soon copied the design for other big churches and cathedrals in northern France. After Abbot Suger\\'s death, the rest of the church was also rebuilt in the new style, and got two more much larger and more decorated rose windows, one on either side.\\n\\nThe style soon spread to England and through France, the Low Countries, Germany, Spain and northern of Italy and Sicily.\\n\\nArchitectural features of Gothic churches \\nNote:- The architectural vocabulary words are written in bold type and are explained and/or shown on the plan and cross-section.\\n\\nRomanesque architecture \\n\"Romanesque\" was the style of architecture in Europe before the \"Gothic\" style. Gothic architecture grew out of Romanesque architecture. There was not a clean break between the two styles.  Many of the features of Gothic architecture did not begin in the Gothic period. They were already there in Romanesque architecture, and slowly changed to become Gothic. The main changes were the pointed arch and the flying buttress. These two developments allowed many other changes to happen.  \\n\\nRomanesque buildings had thick walls, small windows, round arches and flat buttresses. Gothic buildings had thinner walls, larger windows, pointed arches and large buttresses. \\n\\nAll the types of buildings, and the general shape of the buildings were already there in the Romanesque period. The types of buildings were:- the cathedral church, the parish church, the monastery, the castle, the palace, the great hall and the gatehouse.\\n\\nBefore the 20th century, the landmark building in almost every town was a church, cathedral, abbey, or town hall with its tall tower or spire rising high above all the houses. Many of these buildings were from the Middle Ages and were Romanesque or Gothic in style.\\n\\nPlans\\n\\nThe groundplan of most Gothic churches is shaped like a cross. The long nave makes the body of the church and, crossing it, the arms are called the transept. On the other side of the transept is the chancel which is often called the choir because that is where the priest and the choir sing the services.\\n\\nThe nave usually has a passageway or aisle on either side. Sometimes there are two aisles on each side. The nave is usually a lot taller than the aisles, and has high windows which light up the central space. The upper part of the building, where these windows are, is called the clerestory (or clear storey). (It is pronounced \"clair-rest-tree\")\\n\\nSome Gothic churches in Germany and Austria and also Milan Cathedral (which was built in the German style) often have nave and aisles of almost the same height and are called \"hallenkirke\" (hall church). The Cathedral of St. Stephen of Vienna is an example.\\n\\nIn some churches with double aisles, like Notre Dame, Paris, the transept does not stick out beyond the aisles. In English cathedrals the transepts always stick out a long way and sometimes there are two transepts as at Salisbury Cathedral.\\n\\nIt is at the eastern end that Gothic churches are the most different from each other.\\n\\nIn England the eastern end it is usually long and often has two parts. It is usually square or has a \"Lady Chapel\", a place to pray to the Virgin Mary.\\n\\nIn France the eastern end is often polygonal and has by a passage for walking called an ambulatory. Often French churches have a ring of chapels called a chevette. German churches are often like those of France at the eastern end.\\n\\nIn Italy, there is no long chancel jutting out beyond the transept. There is usually just a semicircular chapel as at Florence Cathedral.\\n\\nFeatures of the Gothic style\\n\\n Pointed arches\\n Very high towers and spires and roofs\\n Clustered columns: tall columns that looked like a group of thin columns bundled together\\n Ribbed vaults: arched ceilings made of stone. In the Gothic style they were held up by stone ribs.\\n A skeleton of stonework with great big glass windows in between.\\n Tracery: carved stone lace in the windows and on the walls\\n Stained glass: richly colored glass in the windows, often with pictures telling stories\\n Buttresses: narrow stone walls jutting out from the building to help hold it up\\n Flying buttresses: buttresses that help to hold the vault up. They are made with an arch that jumps over a lower part of the building to reach the outside wall.\\n Statues: of Saints, Prophets and Kings around the doors\\n Many sculptures, sometimes of animals and legendary creatures. Gargoyles spout water from the roof.\\n\\nGrand facade\\nThe \"facade\" or West Front of a large church or cathedral is designed to make a big impression on the worshippers. One of the best known is Notre Dame de Paris.\\n\\nIn the centre of the facade is the main door or portal, often with two side doors as well. In the arch of the middle door is often an important piece of sculpture, usually \"Christ in Majesty\". Sometimes there is a stone post in the middle of the doorway where there is a statue of the \"Madonna and Child\". There are many other carved figures in niches set all around the portals. Sometimes there are hundreds of stone figures carved all across the front of the building.\\n\\nAbove the middle door there is a large window, which is usually a rose window like that at Reims Cathedral, but not in England, Scotland, Belgium or Scandinavia where there will nearly always be a very large pointed window to let in lots of light.\\n\\nIn Italy, the facade is often decorated with coloured marble and mosaic made of little coloured tiles, and not so many statues, as at Orvieto Cathedral\\n\\nThe facade of a French cathedral and many English, Spanish and German cathedrals usually has two towers.\\n\\nHeight\\nLarge Gothic churches and cathedrals are often very tall. On the inside, the nave is usually at least twice as high as it is wide, which gives the church a very tall narrow look. Some of the churches in France and Germany have naves that are three times as high as they are wide. Cologne Cathedral is an example. The tallest nave is at Beauvais Cathedral which is 157.5 feet high. Westminster Abbey is 102 feet high.\\n\\nOn the outside most Gothic churches, both big and small, have at least one tower. In Italy there are domes on the churches, and the tower stands to one side. But in most other countries, cathedrals generally have two towers and quite often have three. Some have even more. Laon Cathedral was planned to have seven, but they were not all built.\\n\\nSometimes there is just one tower with a huge spire as at Salisbury. Lincoln Cathedral had the tallest spire of the Middle Ages at 527 feet (160 metres).\\n\\nBecause a pointed arch points upwards, it makes people look upwards. In Gothic architecture, the whole building is designed to make people look up. There are long narrow columns, long narrow windows and high pointed roofs. On the inside the arches of the roof rise up like branches. On the outside, there are often lots of fancy bits along the edge of the roof and on the tops of buttresses and above the windows. These are called  pinnacles. Milan Cathedral has hundreds of them.\\n\\nLight\\nGothic architecture usually has a lot of windows. Sainte Chapelle is a famous example. At Gloucester Cathedral in England, the East window is as big as a tennis court. Milan Cathedral also has windows of about the same size.\\n\\nThe flying buttresses which arch across the roof of the aisle were used to support the roof above the windows, so the walls did not have to be so thick.\\n\\nThe columns of the inside, the ribs of the vault (or roof) and the flying buttresses, made a strong stone skeleton. in between these parts, the walls and the filling of the vaults could be of lighter thinner material. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.\\n\\nThrough the Gothic period, because of the pointed arch, Gothic windows were able to change from simple openings to very rich designs. The windows were very often filled with stained glass which made coloured light in the building, and was used for story-telling pictures.\\n\\nThe pointed arch\\nPointed arches were used in Persian architecture, and from 641 AD onwards, they were a feature of Islamic architecture. Knowledge of the pointed arch spread into Europe through the Crusaders who travelled to the Middle East from 1096 onwards. Also, Islamic forces had taken over parts of Spain, where they built cities and Mosques with pointed arches.\\n\\nArchitectural historians think that the pointed arch was also used by some European architects because it was a very strong way of making an arch.\\n\\nIn Gothic Architecture, the pointed arch is used in every place where an arch is needed, both for strength and for decoration. Gothic openings such as doorways, windows, arcades and galleries have pointed arches. A row of arches is called an arcade. A row of arches that is up high on a building is a gallery.\\n\\nRows of pointed arches were used to decorate walls. This is known as blind arcading. Often walls were made with tall narrow arched openings in them that could be used to stand statues in. An opening like this is called a niche which is pronounced \"neesh\".\\n\\nVaulted roofs with pointed arches\\nAn arched roof built of bricks or stone is called a vault. In the Romanesque period before the Gothic, some churches had vaulted roofs. They were always based on perfectly semi-circular shapes. There were two main ways to make a nave vault in the Romanesque period. A vault could be long like a tunnel. Churches with this type of vault were always rather dark. Or it could be square, like two tunnels crossing each other. This meant that the columns that carried the vault always had to be placed on a perfectly square ground plan, which was not always possible.\\n\\nOne of the good things about pointed arches was that they could be narrow and tall, or flattened and wide. Using pointed arches, architects could make vaults of very different shapes. They did not even have to be rectangular. A Gothic architect could make a vault with one side narrow, two sides wide and the last side even wider. They could make a vault with three sides or five sides quite easily, by using pointed arches.\\n\\nThe vaults were made of ribs which met each other at the highest part of the vault. In between the ribs were sloping surfaces of stone or brick that could be much thinner and lighter than the ribs. At first the pattern made by the ribs was quite plain, like Romanesque vaults, but architects, particularly in England, soon started adding small ribs in between the main ones and making different patterns. Some vaults like this can also be seen in Spain and Germany, but not usually in France or Italy.\\n\\nDifferent shapes of Gothic arches\\nIn the Gothic period the shape and style of pointed arches changed. But the changes were not the same in every country.\\n\\nWith pointed arches, windows could be made very large. Architects made many designs of pointed arches crossing each other in different ways. These designs were often used in windows, which look as if they are filled with beautiful stone lace. This is called \"tracery\". The stone tracery was used to hold the glass in place. An Architectural Historian can often tell just how old a part of a building is by looking at the window tracery design.\\n\\nLancet arch\\nThe simplest Gothic arch is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. A \"lancet\" is a sharp knife, so these windows are knife-shaped. Very often lancet windows are put together in a group of three or five.\\n\\nSalisbury Cathedral is famous for the beauty of its Lancet Gothic Architecture. In England the style is called \"Early English Gothic\". York Cathedral in England has a group of five lancet windows that are 50 feet high and are still full of ancient glass. They are called the Five Sisters.\\n\\nThese simple windows are also found at Chartres Cathedral and Laon Cathedral in France. They are the most usual sort of Gothic windows in Italy.\\n\\nEquilateral arch\\nMany Gothic openings have tops that are based upon an equilateral triangle. The Equilateral Arch has a very pleasing look and gives a wide opening useful for doorways, arcades and big windows.\\n\\nThese arches are often filled with tracery in circular designs. In England this style is called Geometric Decorated Gothic. It can be seen at many English and French Cathedrals, for example Lincoln cathedral in England and Notre Dame in Paris.\\n\\nFlamboyant arch\\nSome Gothic windows have designs in the tracery, or even in the top of the window itself, that rises up like a flame. This is called Flamboyant Gothic. Tracery like this makes a very rich and lively effect.\\n\\nSome of the most beautiful and famous windows of Europe have this type of tracery. It can be seen at St Stephen\\'s Vienna, Sainte Chapelle in Paris, at the Cathedrals of Limoges and Rouen in France, and at Milan Cathedral in Italy. In England the most famous windows like this are the West Window of York Minster with its design based on the Sacred Heart, the East Window at Carlisle Cathedral and the East window of Selby Abbey. Architectural Historians sometimes argue about which of these is the most beautiful.\\n\\nFlame-shaped arches are not as strong as ordinary pointed arches. It is never used for making a vaulted roof. If this shape is used to make a doorway, there is generally another stronger arch around it. Another way is to make a square topped door that has Flamboyant decoration over the top. In France there are many doorways, both in churches and in houses, that are like this. They are rare in England but there is one at Rochester Cathedral.\\n\\nIn England the Flamboyant style was used wall arcading and niches. The most famous examples in are in the Lady Chapel at Ely, the Screen at Lincoln and the facade of Exeter Cathedral. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture the Flamboyant style is often used for opnwork stone screens. The famous \"pulpit\" in Vienna Cathedral is made like this.\\n\\nDepressed arch\\nThe Depressed arch is wide and looks as if it has been pushed almost flat. When arches like this are used to make great big windows they need to be supported by many tall thin vertical shafts and horizontal transoms, so that the window looks as if it has been divided up into a grid (lots of rectangles). This sort of decoration is used on walls as well. In England the style is called Perpendicular Gothic style.\\n\\nAt Gloucester Cathedral the Perpendicular East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court. There are three very famous large chapels in this style- King\\'s College Chapel, Cambridge; St. George\\'s Chapel at Windsor Castle; Henry VII\\'s Chapel at Westminster Abbey. The other famous example is Bath Abbey.\\n\\nDecoration\\nA Gothic cathedral was designed to be like a model of the universe. Everything about the building was designed to tell a message about God.\\n\\nThe statues, the decoration, stained glass windows and wall paintings told Bible stories such as how God created the world and how he rules over everything that is in the universe, the seasons of the year and the stars in the sky.\\n\\nCarvings near the door often show the signs of the Zodiac because the patterns of stars in the sky were very important to farming people who did not have calendars to tell them when to plant and when to harvest.\\n\\nAbove the main door is often a sculpture of Jesus on a throne, judging the people of the Earth. Many pictures and sculptures are there to remind people to live good lives because they never know what will happen next.\\n\\nMany churches were very richly decorated, both inside and out. the statues were often painted in bright colours but nowadays only tiny bits remain at Chartres cathedral and some other places. Wooden ceilings were usually brightly coloured. Sometimes the stone columns were painted as well.\\n\\nRegional differences\\nEven though some things about Gothic architecture stay the same, other things look different in different countries.\\n\\nBuilding materials\\nDifferent building materials were found in different parts of Europe. This is one of the differences in the architecture between different places.\\nIn France, there was limestone. It was good for building because it was soft to cut, but got much harder when the air and rain got on it. It was usually a pale grey colour. France also had beautiful white limestone from Caen which was perfect for making very fine carvings.\\n\\nEngland had coarse limestone, red sandstone and dark green Purbeck marble which was often used for architectural decorations like thin columns.\\n\\nIn Northern Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, Baltic countries and northern Poland there was no good building stone, but there was clay for making bricks and tiles. So many of these countries have Brick Gothic churches and even Brick Gothic castles.\\n\\nIn Italy, limestone was used for city walls and castles, but brick was used for other buildings. Because Italy had lots of beautiful marble in many different colours, many buildings have fronts or \"facades\" decorated in coloured marble. Some churches have very rough brick facades because the marble was never put on. Florence Cathedral, for example, did not get its marble facade until the 1800s.\\n\\nIn some parts of Europe, there were many tall straight trees that were good for making very large roofs. But in England, by the 1400s, the long straight trees were running out. Many of the trees were used for building ships. The architects had to think of a new way to make a wide roof from short pieces of timber. That is how they invented the hammer-beam roofs which are one of the beautiful features seen in many old English churches.\\n\\nFrance\\nFrench cathedrals, and those in Germany and Belgium are often very high, both inside and outside. The transepts do not stick out far. The facades in France nearly always have three doors, a rose window and two towers. There are often facades with doors on the transepts as well as the front.\\n\\nEngland\\nThe thing that makes English cathedrals different from the others is that they are long, and  look horizontal, like big ocean liners.\\nEnglish cathedrals nearly all took hundreds of years to build, and every part is in a style that is quite different to the next part. (Only Salisbury Cathedral was not built in lots of styles.)\\nThe West window is very large and is never a rose window. The west front may have two towers like a French Cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower at the middle of the building, which may have a big spire.\\n\\nGermany and the Holy Roman Empire\\nIn Germany the towers and spires are often enormously large. Sometimes they are so big that it was impossible to finish them until modern times. The spires are quite different to English spires because they are made of lacy \"openwork\".\\nThere are also many hallenkirke (or hall-churches) which have no clerestorey windows. The nave and the aisles are about the same height.\\n\\nSpain and Portugal\\nLike an English Cathedral, a Spanish or Portuguese Gothic Cathedral is often built in many different styles. They are often wide. Spanish cathedrals often have chapels all around them. The roof often has many different types of towers and spires. Often the central towers are polygonal.\\n\\nItaly\\nItalian Gothic cathedrals use lots of colour, both outside and inside. On the outside, the facade is often decorated with marble. On the inside, the walls are often painted plaster. The columns and arches are often decorated with bright coloured paint. There are also mosaics with gold backgrounds and beautifully tiled floors is geometric patterns.\\nThe facades often have an open porch with a wheel windows above it. There is often a dome at the centre of the building. The bell tower is hardly ever attached to the building, because Italy has quite a few earthquakes. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favorite way of decorating the churches is fresco (wall painting).\\n\\nRelated pages\\n Castle\\n Gothic Revival architecture\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n , from Project Gutenberg\\n\\nOther websites\\n GothicMed.

       "     'content': 'Mosaic is the art of decorating a surface with pictures and patterns made of little pieces of stone, glass or tiles of different colours. Mosaics can be used indoors on walls, floors and ceilings. Mosaics are sometimes used outdoors on pavements.\\n\\nMaking mosaics \\nMosaics are made by setting coloured pieces into \"mortar\" (cement) which sets hard and holds the pieces in place. Some mosaics are made of round pebbles, and have only two or three colours. Other mosaics are made of marble. Many mosaics, particularly in Italy, are made of terracotta tiles. (Terracotta is \"fired\" clay that has been baked in an oven.) Terracotta tiles come in many colours and can be used for colourful pictures as well as patterns. \\n\\nSome tiles look as if they are made of pure gold. These tiles are actually made of glass and have a very thin \"leaf\" of gold stuck to one side. The side with the gold gets put into the mortar. Then the gold can be seen through the glass, but cannot be scratched off.\\n\\nHistory\\nMosaics often last for a very long time. There are still plenty of mosaics which were made by the Ancient Romans. They can be seen in Italy, England, France, as well as  other countries that were once part of the Roman Empire. \\n\\nMany beautiful mosaics date from the early Christian and Byzantine eras, from about 300 AD to 1400, in Italy, Greece, and other countries. The mosaics in churches usually have pictures which tell Bible stories.\\n\\nMosaics were a popular way to decorate churches in Italy in the Medieval period. They were not popular in England, France, Germany and countries of Northern Europe because they preferred to use stained glass windows as decoration. In Italy, the most famous church with its interior decorated with mosaics is St. Mark\\'s Basilica, Venice. At Westminster Cathedral in London, (which is built in an Italian style) the mosaic decoration which was started more than 100 years ago is still continuing, bit by bit. Many of the mosaics at St. Mark\\'s and Westminster Cathedral have gold backgrounds. \\n\\nNowadays mosaics are still used in all sorts of ways. Mosaics are most often used to brighten up public places in cities. Modern mosaics are made of all sorts of materials: mosaic tiles, bathroom tiles, broken roof tiles, broken dishes, broken mirrors, bits of metal and old bricks.\\n\\nGallery\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Fresco \\n Icon \\n Tempera \\n Oil painting \\n Stained glass \\n Byzantine art \\n\\nArt\\nArchitecture',\n",

       "     'content': 'Architecture is designing the structures of buildings. It uses both art and engineering. Examples include houses, churches, hotels, office buildings, roads, viaducts, tunnels and bridges. \\n\\nArchitecture is the profession of an architect. Usually, a person must study at an institution of higher education (university) to become an architect. There were architects long before there was higher education. They learnt by being an apprentice to an established architect. \\n\\nArchitecture can do small designs, such as for a garage, or large designs, such as for a whole city. The capital cities of Brasília, and Canberra were designed. Architecture often overlaps with structural engineering, and architects and engineers often work together.\\n\\n\\n\\nHistory \\n\\nIn the past, people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures, like the Great Pyramids of Giza. The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call \"Classical Architecture\". The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the arch from the Etruscans, who copied it from the Mesopotamians. \\n\\nClassical architecture was formal, and it always obeyed laws. It used symmetry, which really means balance, and it used proportion between shapes. The Golden Mean was a rule which said, (to put it simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times as long as the short side. There are many \\'laws\\' in classical architecture, like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are often used today. However, today more notice is taken of specific facts, such as what wind speeds occur once or twice in a century. Several bridges have blown down because that was not properly taken into consideration.\\n\\nIn some parts of the world, like India, the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles occur in China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America.\\n\\nArchitects in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture, then Gothic architecture. Gothic buildings have tall, pointed windows and arches. Many churches have Gothic architecture. Castles were also built at this time. In Eastern Europe, churches usually had domes. People added their own ideas and decoration to the Classical Architecture of the past. The Renaissance brought a return to classical ideas. \\n\\nIn the late 18th century with the Industrial Revolution, people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many factories and mills were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the Victorian era, architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathedral in Ulm, Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse. This happened to the Beauvais Cathedral, which was never completed. \\n\\nTowards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, steel became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build. An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them skyscrapers. This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings.\\n\\nModernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called \"post-modern\".\\n\\nMany of the world\\'s greatest structures were built by modern-day architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright; Sir Hugh Casson; Norman Foster; I. M. Pei; Adrian Smith; Edward Durell Stone; Frank Gehry; Fazlur Khan; Gottfried Böhm; and Bruce Graham.\\n\\nRelated pages \\n Acoustics\\n Architect\\n Art\\n Building code\\n Building materials\\n Earthquake engineering\\n List of buildings\\n Pattern language\\n Skyscraper\\n Structural Engineering\\n World Heritage Sites\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites\\n\\n American Institute of Architects \\n Australian Institute of Architects\\n Royal Institute of British Architects\\n Royal Architectural Institute of Canada\\n New Zealand Institute of Architects\\n Architecture Citizendium\\n\\n \\nArchitecture sciences\\nConstruction',\n",
